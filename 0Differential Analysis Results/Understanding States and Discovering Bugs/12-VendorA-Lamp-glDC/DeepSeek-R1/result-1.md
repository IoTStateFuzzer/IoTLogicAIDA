State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: No devices added, no users invited
1 | Device added by user1, no shared permissions
2 | Error/No-element state (invalid operations)
3 | user1 invited user2 into home (both have device control)
4 | Device shared with user2 (user2 has legal control permissions via UI)
5 | user2 retains device control capability through knowledge set (attack surface)
6 | Device removed by user1, but attacker retains residual knowledge
7 | user1 removed user2 from home but attacker can replay device control
8 | Device removed and home structure changed, attacker access attempts fail
9 | New device added after previous removal cycle
10 | Re-invited state with device re-added, vulnerable to knowledge replay

# Critical Vulnerability report

## Vulnerability 1: Residual Access Through Device Re-addition Cycle
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker gains valid device control through normal sharing
2. Victim removes and re-adds the device
3. Attaker replays previous control commands to regain unauthorized access

**Repeat steps**:
1. s0 → s1 (user1 adds device)
2. s1 → s4 (user1 invites user2)
3. s4 → s5 (user2 gains control knowledge)
4. s5 → s6 (user1 removes device)
5. s6 → s10 (user1 re-adds device)
6. s10 → s5 (user2 successfully controls re-added device via local replay)

**Vulnerability Analysis**：
The state machine reveals a critical flaw in device lifecycle management. When user1 performs:
- RemoveDevice (transitioning to state 6)
- Followed by AddDevice (transitioning to state 10)

An attacker in state 10 can execute:
```user2|local|DeviceControl → s5```

This demonstrates that the system fails to invalidate previous device authorization credentials after device removal and re-addition. The attacker's retained knowledge ("user2|local|DeviceControl") allows them to:
1. Bypast re-authorization requirements
2. Regain control of the "new" device instance
3. Maintain persistent access through device lifecycle changes

**Security Impact**:
- Permanent device compromise through single successful sharing
- Violates CIA triad through:
  - Integrity: Unauthorized control commands
  - Availability: Persistent access despite security measures
  - Confidentiality: Potential data exfiltration through device status monitoring

**Root Cause**:
The device re-addition process (state 6→10) doesn't reset authorization contexts, allowing historical control commands to remain valid. The authorization system appears to bind permissions to device type rather than specific device instances or sessions.
