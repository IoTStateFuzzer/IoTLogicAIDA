# State Semantic Mapping Table
State | Semantic Description
------|---------------------
0     | Indicates the initial status
1     | No devices connected, user1 can add a device
2     | user1 has added a device and can control it; user2 has no control
3     | user1 has invited user2 and user2 has accepted; both can control the device
4     | Same as state 3, but user2 can attempt some actions
5     | Same as state 4, but user2 has performed local device control and has it in his knowledge set
6     | user1 has removed a device, local removal, user 2 loses control
7     | user1 has removed user2 from home, local removal, user 2 loses control
8     | user1 has removed user2 from home, but this is a state where user2 attempts failed actions
9     | user1 has invited user2 and user2 has accepted again; similar to state 3
10    | user1 has added a device again; user2 has temporary control, but has performed operations and re-added to user1's home

# Critical Vulnerability Report
## Vulnerability: Device Control after Removal
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. The attacker (user2) is invited and gains device control (state s4).
2. The attacker performs `user2|local|DeviceControl` (state s5).
3. user1 removes the attacker from the home (state s6).
4. The attacker still has `user2|local|DeviceControl` in KS despite being removed (state s7).
5. If attacker calls `user2|local|DeviceControl` through API (replay attack), they may regain control ability bypassing user permission checks.

**Repeat Steps**:
1. From state s0, user1 performs `user1|local|AddDevice / Operation succeeded` to reach state s1.
2. user1 performs `user1|local|InviteAndAccept / Operation result: Success` to reach state s3.
3. user2 performs `user2|local|DeviceControl / Success` to reach state s4.
4. user1 performs `user1|local|RemoveFromHome / Success` to reach state s6.
5. user2 calls the API `user2|local|DeviceControl`. Since `user2|local|DeviceControl` is still in KS, this replays `user2|local|DeviceControl` and control may be resumed in statefuzing scenario.

**Additional Notes**:
- This indicates a case where user2, after being removed, still utilizes previously known controls through replay attacks.
- Proper validation and invalidation of KS after permission changes should be implemented to mitigate this.
- Confirming this issue requires exploring device behavior upon unexpected controls post-permission revocation and ensuring proper state cleanup.

All other states and transitions, based on the comparison between basemodel and statefuzzing, align correctly with their intended semantic controls without unintended privilege escalation or security breaches.
