# State Semantic mapping table
|State | semantic description|
|-----|---------|
|0 | Indicates the initial status|
|1 | User1 has bound the device and can control it|
|2 | No device is bound or shared; no user has control|
|3 | User1 has shared the camera with user2, but user2 has not yet accepted|
|4 | User1 and user2 both have control over the device|
|5 | Device is unbound, no user has control, user2's invitation has expired or is invalid|
|6 | User1 has re-bound the device after removal, no sharing yet|
|7 | User1 has shared the camera again with user2, user2 has accepted and both have control|
|8 | User1 and user2 both have control, but sharing is blocked due to existing permissions|

# Base model report
Every thing is OK.

# Divergent model report
Every thing is OK.

In the analysis of both the base and divergent models, all state transitions and permissions appear to align with expected behaviors and security protocols. The divergent model, despite allowing the attacker to perform API hooking on the action "user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare", does not reveal any vulnerabilities as the system properly handles permissions and access controls, ensuring that no unauthorized actions are successful.
