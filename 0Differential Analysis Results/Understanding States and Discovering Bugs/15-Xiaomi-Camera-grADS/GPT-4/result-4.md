# State Semantic mapping table
|State | semantic description|
|-----|---------|
|0 | Indicates the initial status|
|1 | User1 has bound the device and can control it|
|2 | No device is bound, no operations can be performed|
|3 | User1 has shared the camera, but user2 has not accepted yet|
|4 | Both user1 and user2 have control over the device|
|5 | Device is unbound, no operations can be performed|
|6 | User1 has bound the device and can control it, user2 has been invited but not accepted|
|7 | User1 has bound the device and can control it, user2 has accepted the share and can control it|
|8 | Both user1 and user2 have control over the device, user2 has tried to accept the share again but failed due to already being in the family|

# Base model report
Every thing is OK.

# Divergent model report
Every thing is OK.

**Analysis Explanation:**
- The base model correctly handles the permissions and actions based on the user's operations, ensuring that user1 can manage the device and share control with user2. User2 can accept the share and gain control, or the share can be revoked by user1.
- The divergent model, which simulates potential attacker actions through API hooking, does not reveal any vulnerabilities. The state transitions and permissions are managed similarly to the base model, and the attacker's additional capabilities (API hooking) do not lead to unauthorized control or information leakage. The system correctly handles the scenarios where user2 (as an attacker) tries to exploit the system but fails due to the system's robust checks and balances.
