State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state with no devices added
1 | Device added by user1, no sharing active
2 | Error/dead state (invalid operations)
3 | Camera shared by user1, pending acceptance from user2
4 | user2 has accepted camera share, both users have control
5 | Device removed by user1 after sharing, invitation invalidated
6 | Device re-added by user1 after removal, no active sharing
7 | Camera re-shared by user1 after re-adding device
8 | user2 has accepted re-shared camera, persistent control access

# Critical Vulnerability report
**No critical vulnerabilities detected**

Analysis conclusion:
The statefuzzing model maintains proper security controls through:
1. Attacker knowledge set invalidation - Old AcceptDeviceShare attempts fail with proper error codes (-6) after device removal
2. UI operation prioritization - Attackers use legitimate clickable actions when available rather than API replays
3. State isolation - Device removal properly transitions to states (s5/s0) that invalidate previous sharing contexts
4. Error handling consistency - Both models show identical responses for unauthorized control attempts

The observed state transition differences (e.g. s4→s5 vs s4→s0 on RemoveDevice) represent equivalent security postures through different state numbering, with no privilege escalation paths or information leakage vulnerabilities.
