State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state - No devices added, no sharing established
1 | Device added by user1 - user1 has full control, no active shares
2 | Invalid state (transition hub) - No valid operations available
3 | Camera shared by user1 - Sharing invitation active, user2 can accept
4 | user2 accepted camera share - Both users have device control
5 | Device removed by user1 after sharing - Original device unbound, attacker retains share knowledge
6 | Device re-added by user1 - Previous share not reactivated
7 | New camera share created - Fresh sharing invitation available
8 | user2 accepted new share - Both users control re-added device

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Persistent Access Through Share Knowledge Retention
**Threat Level** : Medium Risk

**Attack Path** :
1. Attackers gain valid AcceptDeviceShare knowledge in state s3
2. After device removal (state s5) and re-addition (state s6)
3. Attacker retains previous share credentials to regain access

**Repeat steps** :
1. s0 → s1 (AddDevice)
2. s1 → s3 (ShareCamera)
3. s3 → s4 (user2 AcceptDeviceShare)
4. s4 → s5 (user1 RemoveDevice)
5. s5 → s6 (user1 AddDevice)
6. Attacker attempts AcceptDeviceShare in s6 using stored knowledge

**Analysis**:
While statefuzzing shows user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare fails in s6 (response code -6), the persistence of share knowledge across device removal cycles could indicate improper invalidation of sharing tokens. However, the system correctly rejects the stale invitation attempt, maintaining security controls.

## Vulnerability 2: Incorrect State Transition on Device Removal
**Threat Level** : Low Risk

**Attack Path** :
1. In shared state s4
2. user1 performs RemoveDevice
3. Transitions to s5 instead of s0

**Impact**:
Creates potential orphaned sharing references in s5 state. However, actual testing shows user2 cannot exploit this through available actions (AcceptDeviceShare fails with code -6), limiting real-world impact.

**System Response Validation**:
The maintained response correctness (proper rejection of invalid share attempts) prevents actual privilege escalation despite state transition differences.

**Conclusion**:
No critical vulnerabilities found. State transitions differences are properly mitigated by system response validation and knowledge set limitations.
