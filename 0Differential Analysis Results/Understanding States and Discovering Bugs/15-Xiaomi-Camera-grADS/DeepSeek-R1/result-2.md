State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state. User1 has no devices. User2 has no permissions.
1 | User1 added a device (local AddDevice). User1 has full device control. No sharing exists yet.
2 | Error/Dead state. Most operations return NoElement.
3 | User1 shared camera (ShareCamera). User2 can click AcceptDeviceShare via UI. Device still exists.
4 | User2 accepted device share (AcceptDeviceShare). Both users have device control. User1 can unshare/remove device.
5 | User1 removed shared device. KS retains AcceptDeviceShare but invalid. User1 can re-add device.
6 | User1 re-added device after removal. Similar to s1 but with attacker KS preserved from previous share.
7 | User1 shared camera again in re-added device. User2 can accept new share invitation via UI.
8 | User2 accepted new share. Both have control of re-added device. User2 cannot accept again (already in family).

# Critical Vulnerability report
**No critical vulnerabilities detected**  
The statefuzzing model maintains proper permission revocation and prevents invalid replay attacks through KS checks. All state transitions preserve CIA triad properties:
1. User2's AcceptDeviceShare attempts fail after device removal (s5/s6)
2. Device control permissions are revoked upon unsharing (s4->s6 blocks User2 access)
3. Information leakage is prevented by returning NoElement for invalid operations
4. KS retention doesn't enable privilege escalation due to server-side invitation validation
