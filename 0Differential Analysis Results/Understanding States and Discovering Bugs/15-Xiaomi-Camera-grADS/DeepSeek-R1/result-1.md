State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: No devices added. User1 can add a device locally.
1 | Device added: User1 has device control. Can share camera/remove device.
2 | Invalid state: All operations return NoElement. Indicates invalid request context.
3 | Camera shared: User1 shared camera (unaccepted). User2 can click to accept share.
4 | Shared accepted: Both users have device control. User2 retains replay capability.
5 | Device removed post-sharing: Original device removed but attacker retains share knowledge.
6 | Device re-added: User1 controls new device. Previous shares invalidated.
7 | Camera re-shared: New sharing invitation available for user2.
8 | Re-share accepted: Both users control new device. User2 persists replay capability.

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Persistent Share Knowledge After Device Removal
**Threat Level** : High Risk

**Attack Path** :
1. Attacker gains valid share acceptance capability through normal UI interaction
2. Owner removes device but attacker retains share knowledge
3. After device re-addition, attacker replays share acceptance to regain control

**Repeat steps** :
1. s0 → s1 (user1 adds device)
2. s1 → s3 (user1 shares camera)
3. s3 → s4 (user2 accepts via UI, gains control)
4. s4 → s5 (user1 removes device)
5. s5 → s6 (user1 re-adds device)
6. s6 → s7 (user1 shares camera again)
7. Attacker uses stored KS ["user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare"] to replay acceptance:
   s7 → s8 (via API replay) granting unauthorized control

**Impact** : Allows attackers to maintain persistent access across device removal cycles. Violates integrity and availability by enabling unauthorized control after device reset.

## Vulnerability 2: Improper Permission Revocation
**Threat Level** : Medium Risk

**Attack Path** :
1. After unsharing operation, state transition preserves attacker capabilities
2. Attacker maintains device control despite formal unshare action

**Evidence** :
In statefuzzing s4:
- user1|local|UnshareCamera transitions to s6 (device re-added state)
- Attacker retains KS:["user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare"]
- user2|remote|DeviceControl remains operational in s4

**Impact** : Failed to fully revoke access rights during unsharing operation, enabling continued device control through API replay attacks.
