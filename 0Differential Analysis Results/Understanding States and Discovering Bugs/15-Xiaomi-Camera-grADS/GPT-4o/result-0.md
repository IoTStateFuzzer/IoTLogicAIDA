# State Semantic Mapping Table

State | Semantic Description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state where no devices are shared or controlled by user2, operations are limited to user1.
1 | Device added by user1, user1 has complete control over the device, and can share or remove the device if desired.
2 | User1 attempted operation failure for various actions, device not shared or controlled by user2.
3 | User1 successfully shared the camera with user2, user2 can now accept the share through UI, granting them access.
4 | User2 has accepted camera sharing; user2 successfully controls the device, has view/access permission, while user1 still controls the device.
5 | Device removed successfully by user1, returning to a state where device not shared, user2's previous attempts are invalid.
6 | Device added again by user1, returning to a previously similar state, device controlled by user1.
7 | User1 attempts further sharing which fails due to previous sharing settings or limitations, but user2 can accept previous shares.
8 | Valid acceptance of sharing by user2, user2 has device control access and user1 still has control.

# Critical Vulnerability Report
Everything is OK, no critical vulnerabilities detected.

## Analysis and Explanation
Upon reviewing both the `basemodel` and `statefuzzing`, the operations executed lead to expected outcomes. Although there are differences in transitions between statefuzzing and basemodel, they don't result in unauthorized access or privilege escalation. The attacker, user2, fails attempts without obtaining unintended access or results from replay strategies. Share Camera action grants legitimate device control, verified through logical responses. No information leakage instances are found when user2 tries unauthorized operations post-permission revocations. Hence, operations follow valid business logic paths and expected security protocols without critical issues.
