# State Semantic mapping table

State | semantic description
-----|---------
s0 | Initial state where no device or user configuration has been made. User1 can perform actions like adding a device. User2 has no permissions.
s1 | A device has been added by user1; user1 can control the device. Actions like device share are possible for user1.
s2 | An inactive or error-prone state where most operations are non-functional, likely due to missing devices or invalid permissions for actions.
s3 | user1 has shared the camera with user2, but user2 has not accepted the share yet. User1 has full control and can unshare or remove the device.
s4 | user2 has accepted the device share and now has the ability to control the device. User1 can still unshare or remove the device.
s5 | After removing the device, the system resets to a stale state which appears non-functional or indicative of an error.
s6 | user1 added a device after a previous removal or reset. The system returned to a functional state post-device addition.
s7 | Analogous to state 3; user1 shared the camera again after adding a device.
s8 | Similar to state 4 where user2 has accepted sharing during a repeat cycle of operations, allowing device control.

# Critical Vulnerability report
All states and transitions in the 'statefuzzing' state machine align with the expected behavior regarding device and permission management in IoT, as demonstrated in the `basemodel`. No anomalies, escalation of privilege, information leakage, or unauthorized access were observed.

Thus, everything is inline, and there is no critical security vulnerability noted in comparison with the base model.
