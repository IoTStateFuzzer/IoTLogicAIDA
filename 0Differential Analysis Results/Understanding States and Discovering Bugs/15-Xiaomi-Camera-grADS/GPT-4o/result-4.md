# State Semantic Mapping Table for statefuzzing

State | Semantic Description
-----|--------------------
0 | Initial state where no operations are performed, and no devices or permissions are shared.
1 | user1 has added a device successfully. user1 can control the device.
2 | Unreachable state due to no valid transitions.
3 | user1 has shared a camera, allowing user2 to potentially accept the share.
4 | user2 has accepted the device sharing, gaining temporary control permissions.
5 | Device has been removed by user1, resetting state to before the device was added.
6 | user1 has re-added the device after a previous removal.
7 | After re-sharing the camera, user2 can potentially accept the share again.
8 | user2 has re-gained control permissions after accepting the second share invitation.

# Critical Vulnerability Report

There appears to be no critical vulnerability when comparing the statefuzzing state machine with the basemodel. The sequences of transitions and capabilities match expected behaviors, and there are no identifiable differences that lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. The operations that user2 can perform are in line with the permissions granted through explicit sharing and un-sharing actions.

The state transitions suggest that user2 can only control the device when explicitly shared and loses control upon unsharing, indicating correct permission handling. Additionally, no sensitive information is leaked to user2 post-unsharing, as no control is possible without a successful share operation.

Everything seems OK from a security perspective.
