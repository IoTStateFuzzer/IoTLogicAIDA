# State Semantic mapping table

For **statefuzzing**:

State | Semantic Description
-------|----------------------
s0 | Initial state. No devices or users are added or shared.
s1 | Device added by user1. User1 can control the device remotely.
s2 | An unreachable state for both user actions and Control/Share attempts.
s3 | Camera shared by user1. User1 has remote device control access. Attacker (user2) can click to accept the device share.
s4 | User2 has successfully accepted the shared camera. User2 gains control permissions (vendor info, P2P streaming), but cannot execute AcceptDeviceShare as it is expired.
s5 | Device has been removed after s3 operations. This state involves a failed attempt by user2 to accept the device due to the invite expiration, and the base state of operations on devices being unavailable.
s6 | Device has been added again by user1, with operation success. Reestablishes the state where user1 has control access, and pending operations like sharing.
s7 | Successful sharing, same state transitions as s3 where user2 can accept the share, reinforcing device control setup by user2.
s8 | User2 is in a privileged position having accepted a share, can remotely control while denial of additional share is ensured (already shared error codes).

**Analysis:**

Based on analysis, the **statefuzzing** model maintains appropriate restrictions and transitions. Any divergence from **basemodel** primarily results from potential retries without compromising further security conditions. Notably, user2's operations are constrained once permissions are legitimately revoked, ensuring no unintended permission escalation or information leakage.

# Critical Vulnerability Report

There are no critical vulnerabilities detected in the **statefuzzing** state machine compared to **basemodel**. Each state and transition maintains the integrity of user permissions and operation constraints, preserving CIA principles (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). The divergence in state transitions merely accommodate attacker's knowledge set without granting unauthorized escalation or breaching user data privacy.

Everything is OK.
