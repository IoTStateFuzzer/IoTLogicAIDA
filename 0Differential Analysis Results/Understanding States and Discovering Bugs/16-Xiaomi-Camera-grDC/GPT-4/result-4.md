### State Semantic Mapping Table for `statefuzzing`:

| State | Semantic Description |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| s0 | Initial state. No devices added. No sharing or control granted to user2. |
| s1 | User1 has added a device successfully. User1 can control the device, but user2 has no permissions yet. |
| s2 | No device added or shared. User1 can perform actions like adding, removing, or unsharing devices, but user2 cannot. |
| s3 | User1 has shared a camera successfully. User1 can continue to control the device, and user2 can accept the shared device control. |
| s4 | User2 has successfully accepted the shared device control from user1. User2 now has control over the device, while user1 retains control. |
| s5 | User1 has removed the device successfully. User2 can no longer control the device. |
| s6 | User1 has successfully added a new device. Sharing and control operations available. |
| s7 | Device control operations are restricted due to share limits or denied permissions. User2 has not received valid control rights. |
| s8 | Device control is valid, and user2 has successfully accepted device sharing. User2 can control the device. |
| s9 | User2's device control actions are limited to viewing and receiving device details but cannot control or perform other actions. |
| s10 | User1 adds a device successfully. User2 cannot accept or control any shared device yet. |
| s11 | User1 successfully shared a camera. User2 can now control the device. |
| s12 | Similar to s11, user1 has shared a camera, and user2 can control the device successfully. |
| s13 | User1 can successfully manage devices and share controls, while user2 successfully controls the device with limited actions. |
| s14 | User1 has successfully removed a device. User2 can no longer control the device. |
| s15 | The sharing invitation for the device has expired or failed, preventing user2 from accepting or controlling the device. |
| s16 | Similar to s15, the device invitation has expired. User1 has control, and user2 cannot access or control the device. |
| s17 | User1 can remove the device. User2 cannot control the device anymore. |
| s18 | User2 successfully accepts device control again. User1 can perform device operations. |
| s19 | User2 successfully controls the device after receiving shared access. User1 retains full control. |
| s20 | User1 can share devices. User2 attempts device control but is blocked by invite expiration or other restrictions. |
| s21 | User1 successfully controls and shares devices. User2 can access vendor and control details but with limited control. |
| s22 | User1 can share and remove devices, while user2 attempts to control but fails due to expired sharing permissions. |

### Vulnerability Report

**Everything is OK**. 

Upon analysis, there are no critical vulnerabilities identified in the `statefuzzing` model. All transitions between states are legitimate, and while some differences from the `basemodel` exist, these do not indicate any serious security issues, such as unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
