#   State Semantic Mapping Table for the `statefuzzing` State Machine:

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **s0** | Initial state where no operations have been performed yet. User1 can add or remove devices, share or unshare devices, and user2 cannot interact with any devices. |
| **s1** | Device has been added by user1. User1 can remotely control the device. User2 cannot perform any actions yet. |
| **s2** | Device is in a state where user1 can control it, but user2 cannot control it or access device information. User2 may be invited or share device control permissions. |
| **s3** | Device sharing has been attempted by user1. The sharing operation may have failed or succeeded. User1 can still remove or unshare the device, while user2 can accept the sharing request. |
| **s4** | User2 has successfully accepted device sharing. User1 can control the device, while user2 can also control the device. Both users have device control rights. |
| **s5** | Device has been removed by user1. User2 cannot control the device anymore. All sharing invitations for the device have expired or failed. |
| **s6** | Device has been added again after removal. User1 can still control the device and share it, while user2's previous control permissions have expired. |
| **s7** | Device sharing has been removed by user1. User2 no longer has control over the device but can receive new sharing invitations. |
| **s8** | Device sharing permissions are still valid. User2 has accepted the sharing request and gained device control again. |
| **s9** | User1 has removed the device, and sharing invitations have expired. User2 cannot control the device. |
| **s10** | Device sharing failed due to expired or invalid invitations. User2 cannot interact with the device. |
| **s11** | Device control has been restricted for user2. User1 can add or remove devices and share them. User2 cannot access device controls. |
| **s12** | User2 has access to the device through sharing permissions and can control the device. User1 can still manage the device settings. |
| **s13** | Device sharing is still in place, and user2 retains control over the device. User1 continues to maintain device control. |
| **s14** | User2 successfully accepted a new sharing request. User1 can manage the device, while user2 can control it. |
| **s15** | Device sharing and access permissions for user2 have been revoked. User2 cannot control the device, and user1 has full control. |
| **s16** | Device sharing has been completed. User2 has control over the device but has no further sharing permissions. |
| **s17** | User1 has control over the device, and user2 may not have valid sharing permissions. |
| **s18** | User1 has control over the device and has shared it with user2. User2 has valid device control permissions. |
| **s19** | Device sharing has been successful. Both users can control the device. |
| **s20** | User2 has valid permissions to control the device but has no active sharing invitation to join. |
| **s21** | User1 continues to control the device while user2 may attempt control but will face restrictions due to expired sharing invitations. |
| **s22** | User2 can access and control the device, but no further sharing invitations are available. User1 still maintains control over the device. |

#   Vulnerability Report:

##   Critical Vulnerability Report
###   Vulnerability 1: **Potential Information Leakage**
**Threat Level**: Medium Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker (user2) may temporarily gain valid device control permissions.
2. After removal of control permissions, user2 may attempt to interact with the device.
3. If user2 still receives device information or control responses, it may indicate an information leakage issue.

**Repeat steps**:
1. Start from **s4** where user2 has control.
2. Remove the device by user1, transitioning to **s5**.
3. User2 attempts device control through remote API calls in **s5**, but if user2 receives any device-related information (e.g., device details, payloads), this may indicate a breach in confidentiality.

This analysis highlights a vulnerability where an attacker, after losing control of a device, might still receive device information due to improper validation or leakage within the state machine transitions.
