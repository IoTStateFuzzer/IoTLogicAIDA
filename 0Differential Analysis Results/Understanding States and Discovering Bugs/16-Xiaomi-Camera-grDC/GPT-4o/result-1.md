### State Semantic Mapping Table

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **s0** | Initial state where the device is not yet shared with user2, and user2 has no access or control over the device. |
| **s1** | User1 has added a device successfully. User2 still does not have access. User1 can share and remove the device, while user2 cannot control or accept shares. |
| **s2** | Device is in the process of being shared. User1 can manage the device (add, share, remove), but user2 cannot control the device yet. |
| **s3** | User1 has shared the device, but user2 has not yet accepted the share. User1 can manage the device, but user2 still has no control. |
| **s4** | User2 has successfully accepted the device share and now has control over the device. User1 can still manage the device, including removing or unsharing it. |
| **s5** | User2 attempted to accept a device share, but the invitation was invalid or expired. User1 can still manage the device. |
| **s6** | User1 has removed the device from the family, and the share has been invalidated. User2 cannot access the device anymore. |
| **s7** | User2 has accepted the device share successfully, but user1 still has full control over the device and can manage it as needed. |
| **s8** | User2 has been removed from the device permissions, and is unable to interact with the device unless re-invited by user1. |
| **s9** | User2 cannot perform any action on the device as they no longer have the share invitation. User1 is still able to manage the device. |
| **s10** | Device has been added again, and user1 can perform operations such as sharing or removing, while user2 has no control. |
| **s11** | User2 attempts to access the device share but fails due to some error. User1 still has full control over the device. |
| **s12** | Device share has been successfully revoked or expired for user2. They cannot access the device anymore. |
| **s13** | Device control is functioning normally, but no new actions have been made regarding device sharing. User2 still has the ability to control the device. |
| **s14** | User1 has successfully unshared the device from user2. User2 can no longer access the device until invited again. |
| **s15** | User2 is no longer authorized to access or control the device. User1 still retains the full permissions to manage the device. |
| **s16** | Device share invitation has been canceled or expired. User2 cannot accept the share, and user1 retains full control. |
| **s17** | User2's attempt to accept the device share has failed due to expiration or invalid invitation. User1 can still perform all actions on the device. |
| **s18** | User2 successfully accesses the device after receiving a valid share invitation, and has full control over the device. User1 still retains management control. |
| **s19** | User2 has full device control after successful acceptance of the device share. User1 can still manage the device. |
| **s20** | Device control by user2 is functioning normally, but user1 can still perform actions like removing or unsharing the device. |
| **s21** | User2 has successfully taken control of the device, but is unable to share or remove the device. User1 retains control over sharing. |
| **s22** | User2 attempts to interact with the device but fails to execute control operations due to expired permissions. User1 retains full device control. |

### Vulnerability Report

#### Critical Vulnerability 1: **Attack Path to Gain Device Control**
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. The attacker (user2) accumulates knowledge through successful attempts to accept the device share invitation or performing actions that reveal device control permissions.
2. The attacker can replay "user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare" using their knowledge set in state s9.
3. The attacker bypasses the user permissions check to enter the privileged state in state s18, where user2 obtains device control.

**Repeat Steps**:
Starting from state s0, perform operation `user1|local|AddDevice` to reach state s1, then `user1|local|ShareCamera` to move to s3. Proceed to s4, where user2 accepts the device share. Repeated attempts to perform actions in subsequent states show the attacker gaining temporary control over the device.

---

This indicates the ability for an attacker to gain unauthorized control of a shared device by exploiting weak validation of the sharing mechanism, allowing them to bypass permission checks once they have accumulated the necessary knowledge.
