# State Semantic mapping table
State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: No devices added. User1 can add a device.
1 | Device added by User1. User1 has full control; User2 has no access.
2 | Error/Invalid state (most operations return NoElement).
3 | Camera shared by User1 (pending acceptance). User2 can accept the share.
4 | Camera share accepted by User2. Both users have control permissions.
5 | Device removed after sharing. User2's access revoked.
6 | Device re-added after removal. User1 has control.
7 | Camera re-shared by User1 (pending acceptance).
8 | Camera share accepted again. Both users have permissions.
9 | State after User2 controls device post-revocation (potential attack surface).
10 | Device removed again. User2 retains no valid access.
11 | Device re-added again by User1.
12 | Camera unshared after re-addition (partial permission rollback).
13 | Camera re-shared again (complex sharing state).
14 | Camera shared in re-added device context.
15 | Device removed after multiple cycles.
16 | Device re-added after multiple removals.
17 | Camera shared in persistent environment.
18 | Long-lived shared state with attack potential.
19 | Privilege escalation state (User2 retains control post-unshare).
20 | Partial revocation state (insufficient permission cleanup).
21 | Complex sharing failure state.
22 | Transient shared state with API vulnerabilities.

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Persistent Device Control After Permission Revocation
**Threat Level** : High Risk

**Attack Path** :
1. Attackers accumulate knowledge through legitimate device sharing acceptance.
2. Replay the DeviceControl action in state s20 after permission revocation.
3. Bypass the unshare permission check to maintain persistent control.

**Repeat steps** :
1. Start at s0: user1|local|AddDevice ➔ s1
2. user1|local|ShareCamera ➔ s3
3. user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare ➔ s4
4. user1|local|UnshareCamera ➔ s1 (normal revocation)
5. user2|remote|DeviceControl ➔ s9 (attack success state)
6. user1|local|UnshareCamera in s19 ➔ s20
7. user2|remote|DeviceControl in s20 ➔ Maintains control (s20 loop)

**Vulnerability Analysis**:
The statefuzzing model reveals a critical flaw where User2 retains device control capabilities after permission revocation. Specifically:
- In state s20 (post-unshare), User2's DeviceControl operation remains successful
- This violates the CIA triad through:
  - *Confidentiality*: Unauthorized access to device telemetry
  - *Integrity*: Unapproved device manipulation
  - *Availability*: Sustained access despite revocation

The base model properly revokes access (s4 ➔ s1 on unshare), but statefuzzing introduces persistent access through state s20 where User2 maintains valid control credentials. This matches the pattern of Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 #1) through improper authorization checks during state transitions.
