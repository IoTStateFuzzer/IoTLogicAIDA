# State Semantic mapping table
State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state - no devices added, user2 has no permissions
1 | User1 added a device (has control), no sharing active
2 | Invalid state (transient error state)
3 | User1 shared camera with user2 (pending acceptance)
4 | User2 accepted camera share - both users have control
5 | Device removed after sharing - no active devices
6 | Device re-added by user1 after removal (no sharing)
7 | Camera re-shared by user1 (pending acceptance)
8 | User2 accepted re-shared camera
9 | Post-removal control state - user2 retains device access
10 | Device removed after persistent access state
11 | Device re-added after complex removal cycle
12 | Unshared state with residual user2 access
13 | Re-shared state with access conflicts
14 | Secondary sharing attempt with permission issues
15 | Tertiary removal state
16 | Third device addition cycle
17 | Third sharing attempt
18 | Third acceptance state
19 | Persistent unauthorized control state
20 | Post-unshare state with access leakage
21 | Conflict state from repeated sharing attempts
22 | Complex sharing/removal hybrid state

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Persistent Device Control After Permission Revocation
**Threat Level** : High Risk

**Attack Path** :
1. Attackers accumulate knowledge through legitimate access acceptance
2. Replay the DeviceControl action after permission revocation
3. Bypass the permission revocation check to maintain unauthorized access

**Repeat steps** :
1. From s0: user1|local|AddDevice → s1
2. user1|local|ShareCamera → s3
3. user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare → s4
4. user2|remote|DeviceControl → s9
5. user1|local|UnshareCamera → s12
6. user2|remote|DeviceControl → s12 (successful control maintained)

## Vulnerability 2: Cross-State Session Persistence
**Threat Level** : Medium Risk

**Attack Path** :
1. Attacker establishes valid session through normal sharing
2. Device removal/re-add cycle performed
3. Old session credentials remain valid for new device instance

**Repeat steps** :
1. From s9: user1|local|RemoveDevice → s10
2. user1|local|AddDevice → s11
3. user2|remote|DeviceControl → s11 (successful control of new device instance)
