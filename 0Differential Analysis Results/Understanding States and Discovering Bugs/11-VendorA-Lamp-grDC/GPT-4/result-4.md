# State Semantic mapping table
State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state where no device is added, and no users have been invited yet. User1 can add a device or invite a user, but User2 has no permissions.
1 | State after adding a device. User1 has control over the device but User2 has no access. User1 can remove the device, invite a user, or control the device. User2 cannot perform any actions.
2 | State after removing a device. The device is no longer available in the system. User1 can add devices, control devices locally or remotely, or invite users. User2 has no permissions.
3 | State after User1 successfully invited User2. User2 has been granted control over the device. User1 can manage the devices, invite or remove users, and control the devices. User2 can control the device as well.
4 | State after User1 successfully invited User2, but User2 has not accepted the invitation yet. User1 can manage devices, remove users, and control devices, while User2 cannot perform any actions.
5 | State where User2 has successfully accepted an invitation and gained control over the devices. User1 can still control the device and manage users, while User2 now has access and control over the devices.
6 | State where User2 has lost control permissions. User1 can still control devices, remove users, or invite new users. User2 cannot perform any actions due to revoked permissions.
7 | State after User2's permissions have been revoked but User2 tries to control the device, resulting in no effect or failure. User1 still has full permissions, while User2 has none.
8 | State where User2 tries to control the device again after losing access. User1 still has control over the device, and no new permissions are granted to User2. Any attempt by User2 to control the device fails.
9 | State where User1 has removed User2 but the system still recognizes the previous action, allowing User2 to attempt device control, which fails. User1 still retains full control over devices.
10 | State where User2 attempts device control after being removed from the system. All actions for User2 fail. User1 can still manage the devices and invite or remove users.

**Problem description**: No critical issues identified in basemodel based on the state transitions and permissions outlined. The logic appears valid.

**Problem Path**:
1. s0: Initial state; user1 can add devices, but user2 has no permissions.
2. s3: After inviting User2, User2 can control the device.
