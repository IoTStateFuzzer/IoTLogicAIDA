# State Semantic Mapping Table for statefuzzing

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0 | Initial state: No devices added. User1 and User2 have no control over any devices. |
| s1 | State after device addition attempt by user1. Device has not been successfully added, and both users still have no control over devices. |
| s2 | State where user1 has successfully added a device. User1 can control the device, but user2 has no control rights. |
| s3 | State where user1 invited user2 into the family. User2 has not yet accepted the invitation. User1 has full control over the device, but user2 has no control rights. |
| s4 | State where user1 has invited user2, and user2 has accepted the invitation. User2 now has control rights over the device. User1 has full control over the device. |
| s5 | State where user2 can now control the device, but only remotely. User1 still has full control rights. |
| s6 | State after user2 has interacted with the device but has failed to perform certain actions due to an error. User1 maintains full control over the device. |
| s7 | State where user2 can attempt control over the device again after failing, but it still does not have valid permissions. User1 retains full control. |
| s8 | State where user2 attempts to control the device and encounters errors, similar to state s6. No successful control by user2, and user1 retains full control. |
| s9 | State where user2 has control over the device remotely, but any actions performed by user2 result in error codes. User1 maintains full control. |
| s10 | State where user2 has control over the device successfully after initial failures, but user1 still retains full control. |

# Critical Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Device Control by User2

**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. The attacker (user2) accumulates knowledge through interacting with the device.
2. Replay the "user2|remote|DeviceControl" action in state s5, where user2 has remote control rights.
3. Bypass the security check by controlling the device, potentially gaining unauthorized access to private information or control.

**Repeat Steps**:
Starting from state s0, user1 adds the device, user1 invites user2, and user2 accepts the invitation, which transitions to state s4. User2 then gains control rights over the device. Afterward, user2 attempts to replay the "user2|remote|DeviceControl" action in state s5 and succeeds in controlling the device without appropriate validation checks.
