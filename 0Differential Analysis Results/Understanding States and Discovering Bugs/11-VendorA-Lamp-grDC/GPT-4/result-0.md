# State Semantic Mapping Table
State | Semantic Description
-----|----------------------
0 | Indicates the initial state. At this point, no device has been added, and no user has been invited or has device control. User1 can add a device, but user2 has no control rights.
1 | User1 has attempted operations like adding/removing a device, inviting a user, or controlling the device, but these actions failed. User2 still has no control over the devices.
2 | User1 has successfully added a device and can control it locally and remotely. User2 has no access or control of the device.
3 | User1 attempted to invite or remove user2 but faced issues with the invitation (user2 is already in the database). However, user1 can still remove user2 from the home and control the devices.
4 | User1 has successfully invited user2 to the family, and user2 has accepted the invitation. At this point, user2 has temporary device control privileges and can control the device.
5 | User1 can still control the device after inviting user2, but user2 now has full control of the device after successful invite and acceptance. This state indicates the successful re-invitation or restored privileges for user2.
6 | User1 can still control the device, and user2 does not have control. User2 also faces errors when attempting control due to failed permissions (unauthorized access).
7 | User1 controls the device successfully. User2 temporarily gains control, but it leads to a failed attempt due to access restrictions after certain actions (like failed permissions).
8 | The system faces device control errors for user2. Even after actions, the device doesn't allow user2 any permissions and reports back a resource-not-found error.
9 | User1 maintains control over the device. User2 has failed access permissions, and further control attempts by user2 are blocked with errors or restrictions.
10 | User1 remains in control, and user2 has full control privileges over the device. However, user2 has an error when trying to perform unauthorized actions, indicating a security or permission issue.

# Vulnerability Report
## Vulnerability 1: Privilege Escalation for Attacker (User2)
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker (user2) accumulates knowledge by successfully controlling the device in state 4.
2. In state 5, the attacker replays the `user2|remote|DeviceControl` action.
3. By bypassing the check, user2 gains unauthorized device control in state 5 after a successful invite and acceptance action, even after being removed from the family.

**Repeat steps**:
Starting from state s0, perform the operation `user1|local|InviteAndAccept` to reach state s4, and then perform the operation `user2|remote|DeviceControl` to reach state s5.

**Problem description**: 
In statefuzzing, the attacker (user2) is able to gain device control even after being removed from the family. This action should be denied or prevented if the attacker does not have legitimate access to the device. The ability of user2 to replay an action and re-gain control after being invited and accepted indicates a vulnerability in privilege escalation. The permission management logic does not adequately restrict or validate the state transitions for user2, allowing them to regain control through improper means. 

**Problem Path**:
1. s4: Invite user2 and accept the invitation.
2. s5: Attacker attempts to control the device by replaying the action, and succeeds despite not having legitimate permission.
