# State Semantic Mapping Table

| State | Semantic Description |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| s0    | Initial state: No device added, no user invited. |
| s1    | Device added, but no user invited. |
| s2    | Device removed, no user invited. |
| s3    | User invited and accepted, but no device added. |
| s4    | Device added, user invited and accepted. |
| s5    | User2 can control the device remotely. |
| s6    | User2 tried remote device control but failed. |
| s7    | User2 removed from the home, can't control devices. |
| s8    | User2 tried device control but failed. |
| s9    | User2 failed to control the device remotely again. |
| s10   | User2 successfully controlled the device remotely again. |

# Critical Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Device Control by User2
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. User1 invites User2 to the home and User2 accepts (transition from s0 to s4).
2. User2 gains control of the device (transition from s4 to s5).
3. User1 removes User2 from the home (transition to various states like s7/s6). 
4. User2 can still attempt to control the device using acquired knowledge and succeeds when the conditions favor (transition from s6 to s10).

**Repeat Steps**:
1. Starting from state s0, perform `user1|local|InviteAndAccept` to reach state s4.
2. In state s4, `user2|remote|DeviceControl` can transition to state s5, indicating User2 can control the device.
3. From state s4, perform `user1|local|RemoveFromHome` to transition to s7.
4. Repeat User2's `device control` (`user2|remote|DeviceControl`) based on their knowledge set to transition to states indicating failed attempts s9/s8 and eventually to s10, where the control operation regains success under conditions not strictly validated on continuous privileges revocations.

It should be noted that the vulnerability allows User2 to intermittently regain control of the device despite being removed from the home, posing potential risks such as unauthorized device manipulation, invasion of privacy, and service disruption. The failure to fully revoke the persistent control capability demonstrates a critical security flaw in managing access controls and associated permissions within the smart home environment.
