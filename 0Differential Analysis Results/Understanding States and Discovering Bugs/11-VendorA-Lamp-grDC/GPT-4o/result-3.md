### State Semantic Mapping Table - Statefuzzing State Machine

State | Semantic Description
----- | --------------------
s0 | Initial state. User1 can perform all operations to initialize the system.
s1 | Device has been added to the system by User1 (User1 has control).
s2 | No functional change. System in a NoElement state post-removal or other failure.
s3 | User1 has invited User2, and User2 accepted the invite (User2 has full control of devices).
s4 | User1 invited User2; User2 accepted successfully and now can control devices.
s5 | User2 successfully performed remote DeviceControl action.
s6 | User1 removed User2 from the home. User2 has tried and failed a DeviceControl command.
s7 | User1 removed User2 from the home. User2 has tried and failed a DeviceControl command.
s8 | User1 removed User2 from the home. User2 has tried and failed a DeviceControl command.
s9 | Device has been added again after User1 removed it.
s10 | Device has been added again after User1 removed it. User2 can still perform remote DeviceControl actions.

### State Machine Comparison Report

By comparing the `basemodel` and `statefuzzing` state machines, the following issues were identified:

1. **User Privilege Maintenance:**
   - **Observed Behaviour:** In the statefuzzing model, an attacker (User2) who has lost access to the home should not regain any control. However, we see in states such as s5 that User2 still successfully performs device controls. This should not be possible after their permissions have been removed.
   - **Recommended Correction:** Ensure that all permissions for User2 are revoked post User1’s `RemoveFromHome` command, updating states accordingly.

2. **Information Leakage:**
   - **Observed Behaviour:** Despite User2 being removed, the replay attack suggests there's lingering access. For instance:
     - s4 transitions (User2|remote|DeviceControl) execute successfully.
     - This indicates potential leakage, as User2 should not influence/witness device states post-revoke.
   - **Recommended Correction:** Make clear-cut boundaries in permission enforcement checks to ensure no residual knowledge or control is allowed post-permission removal.

### Critical Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Control Post Revocation
**Threat Level:** High Risk

**Attack Path:**
1. Attackers, i.e., User2, accumulate knowledge and control by initially being invited to the system and accepting the invitation.
2. User2 continues to exercise control with previously gained `DeviceControl` commands through KS operations.
3. Despite User1’s `RemoveFromHome` or `RemoveDevice`, User2 bypasses checks and continues to control the devices in states like s5, s10.

**Repeat Steps:**
1. From s0, follow through `user1|local|InviteAndAccept` to s3.
2. Perform removals and invite-execute `user1|local|RemoveFromHome` leading to s7.
3. Despite operations, observe `user2|remote|DeviceControl` actions reaching s10, showcasing unauthorized control.

### Final Notes
The main threat identified pertains to permission revocation enforcement and potential information leakage through residual device control access. Focus needs to be applied on restricting device access post User2 permission removals and solidifying access control boundaries.

This model test highlights the potential security loopholes enabling attackers to maintain some control post access revocation, validating the priority need for corrective measures in ensuring robust permission change-handling in the IoT ecosystem.
