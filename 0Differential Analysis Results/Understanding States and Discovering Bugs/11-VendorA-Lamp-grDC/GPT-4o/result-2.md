# State Semantic Mapping Table:

State | Semantic Description
-----|---------
s0 | Indicates an initial state where no device is added, no user is invited, and no permissions are granted.
s1 | No operation related to device control or user invitations can be performed successfully.
s2 | A device has been added by user1. User1 can control the device. User2 cannot control the device.
s3 | User1 has invited user2, and user2 has accepted the invitation. Both user1 and user2 have control permissions on the device.
s4 | User2 has control permissions on the device and can perform remote device control successfully.
s5 | User1 has removed the device from the configuration. User1's permissions allow them to re-add it later.
s6 | User1 attempts to remove user2's permissions but this operation is unsuccessful.
s7 | User1 tries to perform any operation which are not allowed or no knowledge of them is available.
s8 | User2 tries to perform device control but it failed due to lack of permissions or invalid commands.
s9 | User1 has added a device and user2 is still trying to control it with an unsuccessful attempt.
s10 | User1 added the device successfully and invited user2 again.

# Critical Vulnerability Report

Everything is OK in the statefuzzing state machine because all state transitions either performed correctly or resulted in expected failures.

### Detailed Comparison Reasoning
Upon reviewing the two state machines (basemodel and statefuzzing), the following observations can be made:

1. All actions that user1 performs transitioning from one state to another (such as adding devices, inviting users, etc.) are consistent in both state machines.
2. User2 only successfully performs actions or makes state transitions in statefuzzing when they have sufficient permission outlined in the initial knowledge set and states.
3. The actions resulting in "NoElement" indicate forbidding behaviors successfully modeled to restrict unauthorized access, control, or other device operations.
4. There are no instances where user2 illegitimately assumes a higher level of control through replay attacks or API calls.

**Conclusion**: Both state machines depict consistent behaviors and no logical errors or vulnerabilities were found in the basemodel and statefuzzing models in this analysis. Everything is confirmed to be securely operating as expected.
