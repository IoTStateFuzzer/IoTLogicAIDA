### State Semantic Mapping Table for Statefuzzing

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0 | Initial state. User1 is not associated with any devices or users. User2 cannot control any device. |
| s1 | User1 can add a device locally and share control. User2 cannot perform any device control actions. |
| s2 | User1 can perform device control actions, but no devices are shared with User2 yet. User2 cannot perform any device control actions. |
| s3 | User1 has added a device. User2 has not yet been invited into the home. |
| s4 | User1 has invited User2 into the family. User2 can accept the invite via QR code. User2 does not have device control. |
| s5 | User1 has invited User2. User2 accepted the invite. Both can share device control permissions. |
| s6 | User1 can add, remove, and control devices. User2 can attempt to control devices but may encounter permission failures. |
| s7 | User1 can perform all device operations. User2 is still not granted control permissions but may interact with devices under certain conditions. |
| s8 | User1 can perform all device operations. User2 still lacks full control permissions. User2's attempts to scan QR codes fail. |
| s9 | User1 can perform device operations. User2 still lacks device control and cannot interact with devices. |
| s10 | User1 can control devices, share control, and manage devices. User2 can attempt to accept invites but faces permission issues. |
| s11 | User1 can control devices. User2 can try to accept invitations or scan QR codes but faces multiple failures. |
| s12 | User1 can perform device operations. User2's actions are restricted, and User2 faces failures in several operations like scanning QR codes. |
| s13 | User1 has complete control over devices. User2 can try to accept invitations, but device control is not granted. |
| s14 | User1 continues to have device control rights. User2 faces challenges with control due to failed permission processing. |
| s15 | User1 can execute control actions. User2 may still struggle to achieve control, with possible errors in their operations. |
| s16 | User1 has control rights. User2 can execute certain commands but encounters operational failures due to permissions being reset or missed. |
| s17 | User1 has complete device control. User2 may try commands that fail due to errors in communication or permission issues. |
| s18 | User1 can control devices. User2 encounters issues with scanning QR codes or obtaining control due to device resets or rebindings. |
| s19 | User1 can perform device operations, but User2's actions fail, including attempts to control devices. |
| s20 | User1 continues to have full device control. User2 can try to interact with devices but may face errors due to lack of permissions. |
| s21 | User1 can control devices. User2 faces errors with certain operations but may still execute some actions like accepting invitations. |
| s22 | User1 maintains device control. User2 can try actions but faces persistent errors, indicating insufficient permissions or device issues. |
| s23 | User1 retains control over devices. User2 may face repeated issues with permissions and fail to interact with devices properly. |
| s24 | User1 can control devices, while User2 may face issues with control and scanning QR codes. User2's actions are limited. |
| s25 | User1 can continue device management. User2 faces difficulties but can attempt to interact with devices under certain conditions. |
| s26 | User1 maintains device control. User2 continues to face issues related to permissions, scanning failures, and other operational barriers. |
| s27 | User1 retains control over devices. User2 faces failures in multiple operations due to restrictions and operational failures. |
| s28 | User1 has device control. User2 encounters issues with scanning QR codes or resetting devices. |
| s29 | User1 can control devices. User2 faces issues with device interactions, including operational failures and permission problems. |
| s30 | User1 continues to perform device operations. User2 can attempt to control devices but encounters frequent permission-related issues. |
| s31 | User1 has full control over devices. User2 faces barriers in executing some commands due to permission issues or system failures. |
| s32 | User1 can execute all device control actions. User2 struggles with scanning QR codes and executing commands due to permission issues. |

### Vulnerability Report

**No critical vulnerabilities detected** in the statefuzzing model. 

While there are several transitions where User2 encounters permission issues or operational failures, these seem to be consistent with the expected behavior based on the user role and knowledge state. There are no significant deviations in logic that would indicate a bypass of critical security measures or unauthorized access to device control.

However, attention should be paid to **failed permission operations** or **information leakage** that might be investigated further to ensure sensitive data is not exposed inappropriately.
