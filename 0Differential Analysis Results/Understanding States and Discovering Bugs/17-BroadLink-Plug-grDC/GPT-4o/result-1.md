# State Semantic Mapping Table for `statefuzzing`:

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0 | Initial state where no devices are controlled or shared. User2 cannot perform any actions. |
| s1 | User1 can control devices. User2 has no device control permissions. User1 can add devices, invite others, and manage their family group. |
| s2 | Devices are controlled by User1, but User2 has no permissions for device control or invitations. |
| s3 | User1 can control devices, add new ones, or invite others. User2 cannot control devices or interact. |
| s4 | User1 can invite others into the home. User2 is still restricted from performing any actions. |
| s5 | User1 has successfully invited User2. User2 can accept the invitation but has no control over devices at this point. |
| s6 | User2 can now accept the invitation and interact with the home. However, no devices are controlled yet. |
| s7 | User2 has accepted the invitation and can control devices, but no further permissions are granted beyond this point. |
| s8 | User2 has limited control, especially on remote actions. User1 can still manage all devices. |
| s9 | User1 can manage devices but no other members have permissions. |
| s10 | User1 is fully in control, and User2 can access limited functions. User2 is restricted from critical operations. |
| s11 | User1 can add, remove devices and manage family, while User2 remains restricted. |
| s12 | User2 remains restricted from device control and other actions, while User1 retains full control. |
| s13 | No device control for User2. Full control is retained by User1. |
| s14 | User1 retains all permissions, and User2 still cannot control devices. |
| s15 | User2 has limited device control and cannot perform actions that require additional permissions. |
| s16 | User2 can try remote control actions but is limited in the scope of operations. |
| s17 | User2 continues to be limited, and no significant permissions are granted. |
| s18 | User1 continues to have full control, while User2 has restricted access with possible failed actions. |
| s19 | User2 has limited device control but cannot perform other key operations. |
| s20 | User1 has full permissions, and User2 is still restricted from critical actions. |
| s21 | User2’s control is limited to specific actions, with several failed operations. |
| s22 | User1 maintains full control, and User2 cannot perform critical operations like device control. |
| s23 | User2’s remote control attempts fail, and full access remains with User1. |
| s24 | User1 continues to control devices, while User2 has very restricted actions. |
| s25 | User2 can perform specific actions under restricted permissions, with no major control granted. |
| s26 | User1 retains full control, while User2’s actions are restricted. |
| s27 | User2 has limited control, but all crucial permissions remain with User1. |
| s28 | User2's actions remain restricted. User1 retains all permissions. |
| s29 | User1 controls devices, and User2 is limited to basic actions only. |
| s30 | User2 is restricted from critical actions. User1 has full permissions. |
| s31 | User1 retains full device control, and User2 has limited remote control permissions. |
| s32 | User1’s full control continues, while User2 remains restricted from many key actions. |

# Vulnerability Report:

**No Critical Vulnerabilities Detected:**

Upon analysis of the `statefuzzing` model, all transitions follow the expected permission structure for both User1 and User2, with proper control limitations in place for the attacker (User2). Even when User2 gains limited control, this does not extend to full access or privilege escalation in any state. While User2 might attempt to replay actions or interact with the system in certain states, the output does not lead to any security breach or privilege escalation.
