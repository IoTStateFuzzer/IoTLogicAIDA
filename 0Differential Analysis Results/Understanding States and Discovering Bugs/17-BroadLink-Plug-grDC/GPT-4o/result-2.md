### State Semantic Mapping Table

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0 | Initial state. User1 can add devices, invite User2 into the home. User2 has no device control permissions. |
| s1 | User1 has successfully added a device. User1 has device control, while User2 still has no permissions. |
| s2 | User1 can continue to manage devices and permissions. User2 still has no permissions. |
| s3 | User1 invites User2 into the home. User2 has no permissions yet. |
| s4 | User1 continues device management. User2 can accept invitations and scan the QR code. User2 does not yet have device control. |
| s5 | User1 has added a device and shared control. User2 has accepted the invite and gained control. |
| s6 | User1 manages devices and invites. User2 has successfully accepted the invite and is now in the family, with device control permissions. |
| s7 | User1 manages devices. User2 can control devices and is part of the family, with proper permissions. |
| s8 | User1 continues managing devices. User2 has control over devices and can interact with them, but certain operations may fail due to errors. |
| s9 | User1 manages devices and invites. User2 has no permissions but can scan QR codes, though some actions may fail. |
| s10 | User1 adds a device. User2 can interact with devices. |
| s11 | User1 manages devices. User2's device control operations may fail. |
| s12 | User1 manages devices and invites. User2 can scan QR codes and leave the home. |
| s13 | User1 continues managing devices. User2 may have intermittent failures while attempting to control devices or perform operations. |
| s14 | User1 invites User2 to join the home. User2 accepts and gains device control permissions. |
| s15 | User1 manages devices. User2 gains temporary device control permissions. |
| s16 | User1 continues device management. User2 experiences occasional failures in operations due to device reset or rebind needs. |
| s17 | User1 manages devices. User2 experiences failures due to device reset/rebind issues but may interact with devices. |
| s18 | User1 manages devices. User2 experiences occasional failures in device control due to status errors. |
| s19 | User1 manages devices. User2 has permission to control devices. |
| s20 | User1 manages devices. User2 can control devices, and some operations may succeed. |
| s21 | User1 manages devices. User2's operations may intermittently fail due to device issues. |
| s22 | User1 manages devices. User2 may face temporary failures due to device reset/rebind issues but can control devices otherwise. |
| s23 | User1 manages devices. User2 successfully interacts with devices. |
| s24 | User1 manages devices. User2 may encounter occasional device control failures. |
| s25 | User1 manages devices. User2 can successfully interact with devices after receiving control. |
| s26 | User1 manages devices. User2 may face issues but can interact with devices in certain cases. |
| s27 | User1 manages devices. User2 can control devices, though certain operations may fail. |
| s28 | User1 manages devices. User2 experiences occasional failures. |
| s29 | User1 manages devices. User2 successfully controls devices, with minor interruptions. |
| s30 | User1 manages devices. User2 has temporary control permissions. |
| s31 | User1 manages devices. User2 successfully controls devices after gaining permissions. |
| s32 | User1 continues device management. User2 experiences occasional operation failures but remains able to interact with devices. |

### Vulnerability Report

# Critical Vulnerability Report
## Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Access to Device Control Permissions
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker (User2) successfully scans the QR code generated by User1 (user1|local|InviteToHome).
2. The attacker uses this information to access the home, receiving temporary device control permissions.
3. The attacker exploits this temporary access by reusing prior knowledge (KS) to control devices that should be restricted.

**Repeat steps**:
Starting from state s0, perform operation "user1|local|InviteToHome" to reach state s3. Then perform "user2|remote|AcceptInvite" to reach state s5, where User2 successfully gains device control permissions.

---

This analysis reveals a potential vulnerability regarding temporary permissions granted to attackers through valid invitations, which they may exploit if there are inconsistencies in permission revocation or device management logic. Additionally, some device control issues might be related to failures in the resetting/rebinding process, causing unpredictable behavior in the attackerâ€™s control over devices.
