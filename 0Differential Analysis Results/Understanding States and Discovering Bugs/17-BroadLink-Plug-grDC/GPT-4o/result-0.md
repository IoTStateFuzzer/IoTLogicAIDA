# State Semantic Mapping Table

State | Semantic Description  
-----|-----------------------  
0 | Initial state. User1 and User2 are not interacting with any devices.  
1 | User1 has added a device. User2 has no actions available.  
2 | Device removed by User1. User2 still cannot interact with devices.  
3 | User1 invites User2 into the home. User2 has not accepted yet.  
4 | Device removed by User1. User2 cannot interact with devices yet.  
5 | User1 invites User2 into the home, and User2 accepts. User1 can control the devices.  
6 | User1 has successfully invited User2, and User2 has accepted. User2 can now control devices remotely.  
7 | User1 is controlling the devices, and User2 is still interacting with them remotely.  
8 | User2 can control the device, but their permissions have not been fully granted.  
9 | User1 interacts with the device, but User2 still lacks control permissions.  
10 | User1's invitation was accepted, and User2 has now been added to the family. User2 can access devices.  
11 | User1 can still control the device, while User2's access is limited based on their permissions.  
12 | User1 and User2 continue their operations, but User2 has no permissions.  
13 | User1 has invited User2 to the home again, and User2 is about to accept.  
14 | User1's actions, including inviting and controlling devices, continue. User2 remains with limited permissions.  
15 | User2 now has access to control the devices remotely due to their invitation.  
16 | User2 is trying to interact with the devices, but permissions are restricted for some operations.  
17 | User2 can control devices but is restricted from full access.  
18 | User2 tries to perform actions with limited permissions, affecting their ability to interact.  
19 | User2 still lacks proper permissions, and their interaction with devices is constrained.  
20 | User2 can now interact with the devices with greater success due to changes in their permissions.  
21 | User2 can perform operations on devices, but some commands fail due to permission restrictions.  
22 | User2's permission to interact with the device continues but is limited.  
23 | User2â€™s actions on the device are restricted, and their knowledge set impacts their capabilities.  
24 | User2 has attempted to use commands that fail, indicating missing knowledge or permission.  
25 | User2's access to devices is now more restricted, and they have failed interactions due to knowledge gaps.  
26 | User2 lacks necessary information to interact successfully, despite the available attempts.  
27 | User2's actions are heavily restricted due to missing permissions or information.  
28 | User2 still cannot access the devices properly despite attempts, and their knowledge set is missing key information.  
29 | User2 tries to access devices and execute commands, but their actions fail due to limitations.  
30 | User2 has limited access, unable to interact fully with the devices, but actions succeed in some cases.  
31 | User2 can access some devices, but their permissions still prevent them from performing certain actions.  
32 | User2 is blocked from interacting with the devices due to missing permissions or knowledge.  

# Critical Vulnerability Report
## Vulnerability 1: Insufficient Permission Validation on State Transitions
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:  
1. The attacker (User2) obtains some temporary permissions through actions such as accepting an invitation.
2. User2 attempts to replay actions by scanning QR codes or accepting invitations through the UI.
3. User2 successfully replays the actions in states where their knowledge set is incomplete, leading to gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information or controlling devices without proper permissions.

**Repeat steps**:  
Starting from state s0, User1 performs a valid invitation operation, and User2 accepts the invitation. The attacker can replay valid actions after being granted temporary access, leading to a privilege escalation. After scanning the QR code or accepting the invite in states like s6 or s15, User2 may gain unauthorized control of devices, depending on their knowledge set.
