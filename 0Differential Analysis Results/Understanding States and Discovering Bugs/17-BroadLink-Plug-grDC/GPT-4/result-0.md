# State Semantic Mapping Table (Statefuzzing)

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0    | Initial state. User1 has no devices and has not invited any users. User2 has no permissions. |
| s1    | User1 has added a device locally. User1 can control the device locally. User2 has no permissions. |
| s2    | User1 has added a device locally. No device control permissions granted to either user. User2 has no permissions. |
| s3    | User1 has added a device and invited User2 to the home. User1 retains control over the device; User2 can accept the invitation but has no permissions yet. |
| s4    | User1 has added a device and invited User2 to the home. User2 can accept the invitation and gain access. No device control for either user. |
| s5    | User1 has added a device and invited User2 to the home. User2 has successfully accepted the invitation and now has temporary device control. User1 retains control. |
| s6    | User1 has added a device and invited User2. User2 accepted the invitation but cannot perform actions. |
| s7    | User1 added a device. User2 can control the device remotely with valid permissions. |
| s8    | User1 added a device. User2 cannot control the device due to a failure in the system. |
| s9    | User1 added a device, but User2’s control permissions are not granted. |
| s10   | User1 invited User2 into the family, and User2 has accepted the invitation. User2 now has access but cannot control devices. |
| s11   | User1 added a device. User2 attempts but fails to control the device. |
| s12   | User1 invited User2 into the home. User2 cannot interact with the device after failing the invitation process. |
| s13   | User1 added a device. User2 can attempt to interact with the device but cannot gain control. |
| s14   | User1 invited User2 into the home. User2 accepted, but User2 cannot control the device. |
| s15   | User1 added a device. User2 now has control permissions remotely due to successful device command execution. |
| s16   | User1 added a device and invited User2, but User2 cannot control the device remotely due to failure in the invitation process. |
| s17   | User1 added a device, invited User2, but User2’s interaction fails after accepting the invitation. |
| s18   | User1 added a device. User2's attempt to control it remotely is unsuccessful due to device reset requirements. |
| s19   | User1 added a device. User2 successfully controls the device remotely. |
| s20   | User1 added a device and invited User2, who successfully gains control over the device remotely. |
| s21   | User1 added a device. User2 successfully controls the device remotely. |
| s22   | User1 added a device. User2 has partial control, but is not allowed to perform full actions. |
| s23   | User1 added a device. User2 attempts remote control but the attempt fails due to system errors. |
| s24   | User1 invited User2. User2 successfully controls the device but cannot perform other actions. |
| s25   | User1 added a device. User2 successfully controls the device remotely, able to interact with it. |
| s26   | User1 added a device. User2 interacts but fails to gain proper permissions for control due to system failure. |
| s27   | User1 added a device. User2 has failed attempts to gain control. |
| s28   | User1 added a device and invited User2. User2 cannot interact with the device remotely due to connection issues. |
| s29   | User1 added a device. User2 gains control remotely after successfully completing device-related commands. |
| s30   | User1 added a device. User2 successfully controls the device, with full access. |
| s31   | User1 added a device. User2 successfully controls the device but faces operational errors. |
| s32   | User1 added a device. User2 successfully controls the device remotely but some operations fail due to system instability. |

### Vulnerability Report

**Critical Vulnerability Report**

## Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Device Control

**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker (User2) accumulates knowledge through previous interactions (via knowledge set updates).
2. Attacker attempts to replay "user2|remote|DeviceControl" in state s7, gaining access to control devices that they should not have access to.
3. The attacker bypasses security checks by replaying the device control action, potentially gaining unauthorized control over devices in the home.

**Repeat Steps**:
Starting from state s0, User1 adds a device, and User2 attempts to replay the action "user2|remote|DeviceControl" in state s7. If successful, User2 gains device control without explicit authorization from User1. 

### Findings:
The statefuzzing model reveals a potential vulnerability where User2 can gain control over devices remotely by replaying certain actions, bypassing initial authorization logic. This could allow attackers to escalate privileges within the smart home system.
