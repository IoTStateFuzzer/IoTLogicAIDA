# State Semantic Mapping Table

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0 | Initial state where no devices are added or user permissions are configured. |
| s1 | User1 has added a device and can control it, but user2 has no access. |
| s2 | User1 has added a device but neither user can perform any actions yet. |
| s3 | User1 has invited user2 to the family, and user2 can accept the invitation. |
| s4 | User1 is ready to invite user2 again after user2 was removed or not yet in the family. |
| s5 | User1's invite has been accepted by user2, giving user2 access to devices. |
| s6 | User2 has successfully joined the family and can control devices locally. |
| s7 | User2 is interacting remotely with a device, having received legitimate permissions from user1. |
| s8 | User2 tries to control a device remotely, but encounters failures (e.g., corrupted messages). |
| s9 | User2 encounters failure while attempting remote control or scanning QR codes. |
| s10 | User1 has successfully invited user2 to the family, and user2 can now accept. |
| s11 | User2 is able to join the family and can attempt controlling devices but faces issues. |
| s12 | User1's permission to add or remove devices is reactivated, and user2 may try to control devices again. |
| s13 | User1 is repeating the process of inviting user2 into the family. |
| s14 | User1 and user2 have mutual control permissions, and both can control devices. |
| s15 | User2 has remote access to devices after gaining control, indicating successful sharing. |
| s16 | User2 encounters failures due to device-specific issues, requiring reconfiguration. |
| s17 | User2 has failed attempts at scanning QR codes but still has a chance to quit the family. |
| s18 | User1 performs successful actions on devices; user2 faces issues related to control permissions. |
| s19 | User1 successfully controls devices and invites user2 again. |
| s20 | User1 performs actions that allow user2 to interact, but user2 faces specific failures in control. |
| s21 | User2 attempts to interact with devices but faces remote control failures. |
| s22 | User2 faces issues with device control permissions but can attempt to join the family again. |
| s23 | User2 attempts to quit the family while facing specific failures related to interaction. |
| s24 | User2 is interacting remotely but encounters failures and cannot gain control. |
| s25 | User1 maintains control and invites user2 to join the family after failed interactions. |
| s26 | User2 faces issues with device control and permission sharing, requiring reconfiguration. |
| s27 | User2 attempts remote interactions but faces errors while attempting to join or control devices. |
| s28 | User1 successfully adds devices, but user2 encounters reconfiguration issues. |
| s29 | User2 can attempt to interact with devices, but various failures arise, leading to lack of control. |
| s30 | User2 is able to remotely control devices under valid permissions, but other interactions fail. |
| s31 | User2 experiences remote control success but faces issues with other functionalities. |
| s32 | User2 has access to control devices remotely but faces device-specific reconfiguration failures. |

# Vulnerability Report

## No vulnerabilities detected: 
All operations in the statefuzzing model appear to conform to the expected behavior outlined in the basemodel, considering the state transitions and permissions. Any deviations, such as actions in statefuzzing that may not follow the basemodel directly, do not result in any legitimate security risks or permission bypasses.
