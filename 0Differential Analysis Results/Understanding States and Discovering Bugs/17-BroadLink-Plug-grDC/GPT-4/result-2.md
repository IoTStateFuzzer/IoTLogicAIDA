# State Semantic Mapping Table

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0     | Initial state; user1 can add devices, invite others, and perform device control operations. No permissions for user2. |
| 1     | User1 has successfully added a device and invited user2; user1 can manage devices and share them. User2 cannot perform any operations yet. |
| 2     | Device control is disabled for both users. No actions can be performed by either user in this state. |
| 3     | User1 can add or remove devices, invite users, and control devices; user2 can scan a QR code to accept the invitation. |
| 4     | User1 is still managing devices and inviting user2. User2 can accept the invitation and control devices after accepting. |
| 5     | User1 has shared device control; user2 has accepted the invitation and can now control the devices, but user1 can still manage everything. |
| 6     | User1 can manage devices and invite others. User2 has temporarily gained device control through an invitation but cannot manage devices. |
| 7     | Similar to state 6, but with more actions available for user2, including controlling the device remotely. |
| 8     | User1 continues managing devices and inviting others, while user2 can control the devices but no new actions are permitted for user2. |
| 9     | Same as state 8, but user2 can now attempt to quit the family or perform other actions related to their participation. |
| 10    | User1 can add, remove, or control devices, while user2 has limited control, such as quitting the family or scanning QR codes. |
| 11    | User1 can continue inviting, removing, and controlling devices. User2 can control devices or quit, based on the current setup. |
| 12    | User1 still has full control of the devices, and user2 can perform control actions but no management tasks. |
| 13    | User1 can manage devices and re-invite user2. User2 can perform certain control actions and quit the home or perform other relevant actions. |
| 14    | User1 retains all control, while user2 may attempt to regain control over devices, but no permanent actions are allowed without new permissions. |
| 15    | User1 continues device management, and user2 has more permissions to perform actions like accepting invitations and controlling devices. |
| 16    | Similar to state 15, but user2 is more restricted from actions like scanning QR codes due to errors encountered. |
| 17    | Same as state 16, but now the actions of user2 are further restricted, resulting in failed attempts for QR scanning. |
| 18    | User1 can still manage the system, and user2 has very limited control; errors in device control reset the system state. |
| 19    | User1 retains full control, while user2’s actions are still restricted with errors occurring for control commands. |
| 20    | User1 can still manage the system while user2 can perform basic control but with errors that limit the full control experience. |
| 21    | User1 is active in management roles while user2 is restricted from certain actions, including attempting to control devices remotely. |
| 22    | User1 still holds control; user2’s actions are mostly blocked or fail due to permission issues. |
| 23    | User1 continues to manage devices, and user2 can attempt control but faces challenges like broken functionality or errors. |
| 24    | User1 maintains control over the home, and user2 faces similar issues as in previous states, with the added limitation of device control errors. |
| 25    | User1 retains full control, while user2 can perform limited actions, often ending in errors or failure of control operations. |
| 26    | User1 still holds full management rights. User2’s actions are constrained due to repeated failures and errors encountered. |
| 27    | User1 retains device management, while user2 has further restricted access to actions, facing issues with permission-based errors. |
| 28    | User1 can manage the system fully. User2 is restricted from performing any useful operations, and all actions lead to errors. |
| 29    | User1 is still in control, and user2 continues to face permission-based issues or errors in performing actions. |
| 30    | Same as state 29, with user2 facing restrictions but having some access to device control remotely. |
| 31    | User1 retains full control. User2 is unable to perform valid actions due to errors or permission restrictions. |
| 32    | Same as state 31, with minor changes where user2 can occasionally try to control devices, but ultimately faces failure. |

# Critical Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1: User2 Can Temporarily Gain Control Through Invite Mechanism
**Threat Level**: Medium Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. User2 accumulates knowledge about the device control functionality by interacting with the system.
2. User2 accepts the invitation via UI actions, obtaining temporary device control permissions.
3. User2 can control devices after accepting the invite, despite initially having no permissions.

**Repeat steps**:
Starting from state s0, user1 generates an invitation. User2 scans the QR code and accepts the invite, transitioning to a state where user2 has temporary control over the devices, despite not being originally permitted to do so.

---

The vulnerability stems from how invitations are handled and how temporary control is granted to user2 through accepted invitations. Even after permissions are revoked, user2 could re-enter the system with temporary control, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
