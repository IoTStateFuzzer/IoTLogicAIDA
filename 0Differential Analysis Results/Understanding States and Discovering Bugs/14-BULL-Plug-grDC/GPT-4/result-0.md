# State Semantic mapping table

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0 | Indicates the initial status - No device is added or shared, and no user has control. |
| s1 | A device has been added by user1; no device sharing or control by user2. |
| s2 | Represents a neutral or error state where actions to change device or user status are not applicable or result in no change. |
| s3 | User1 has shared a device with User2 successfully. User1 has device control, and user2 can accept the share. |
| s4 | User2 has accepted the device share and has control over the device along with user1. |
| s5 | User2 controls the device, indicating that User2 has previously accepted a share invitation from User1. User1 tries to share or unshare unsuccessfully but retains control over the device. |
| s6 | Similar to s5, but it is the state after User1 has successfully unshared the device and then reshared it with user2. User1 now has control, and user2 can accept the share again. |
| s7 | In this state, user1 has unsuccessfully attempted to share or unshare the device multiple times, leaving user2 with control from a previous successful share. This state also indicates an attempt by user1 to re-share the device with user2. |
| s8 | User1 has removed the device, and no user has control over it. Attempts by user2 to control the device fail due to server-side rejection. |

The `statefuzzing` model introduces new states (s5, s6, s7, and s8) that are not found in the `basemodel`, reflecting additional complexities in user interactions, especially those involving device sharing and control transitions.

## Critical Vulnerability report
There are no explicit security vulnerabilities detected through the state transitions alone in the provided `statefuzzing` state machine documentation that indicate a direct violation of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). However, the complexity introduced by additional states around device sharing, control, and removal operations warrants a deeper examination in a real-world context to ensure that access controls and user permissions are strictly enforced at every state change, especially around the sharing and unsharing of devices (states s5, s6, s7).

Given the abstract nature of the state machine descriptions and the focus on logical transitions without specific exploit mechanisms listed, no direct high-risk vulnerabilities are reported. However, the operators of this smart home IoT scenario should remain vigilant in reviewing detailed logs and user actions for potential patterns of abuse or unintended privilege escalations, particularly around the user2's control gained through device sharing processes.

Overall, the system described through `statefuzzing` appears to correctly manage user permissions and device control through its various states, with each action leading to an appropriate state change. While complex, this does not inherently indicate a security risk without more context on the implementation details and restrictions enforced at each state transition.
