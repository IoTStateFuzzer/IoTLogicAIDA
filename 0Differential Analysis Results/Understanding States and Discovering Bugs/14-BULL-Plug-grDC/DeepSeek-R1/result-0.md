State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: No devices added. User1 can add a device.
1 | Device added by User1. User1 can share, remove, or control the device.
2 | Invalid state (failed operations).
3 | Device shared by User1. User2 can accept the share.
4 | Share accepted by User2. Both users can control the device.
5 | User2 retains control after state transition from s4. User1 can unshare/remove device.
6 | After unsharing in s5. User2 still has device control capability.
7 | Device reshared by User1 from s6. User2 can re-accept share.
8 | Device removed. User2 control attempts fail.

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Post-Unsharing Access Retention
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker gains temporary access through legitimate sharing
2. Owner revokes sharing privileges through UI
3. Attacker maintains persistent control capability after revocation

**Repeat Steps**:
1. From s0: user1|local|AddDevice ➔ s1
2. s1: user1|local|SharePlug ➔ s3
3. s3: user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare ➔ s4
4. s4: user2|remote|DeviceControl ➔ s5
5. s5: user1|local|UnsharePlug ➔ s6
6. s6: user2|remote|DeviceControl remains valid

**Security Impact**:
- Integrity Violation: Attacker maintains control of device after permission revocation
- Privilege Escalation: Temporary user gains permanent access rights
- Non-repudiation Failure: System fails to enforce permission revocation

**Technical Analysis**:
The statefuzzing model reveals a critical divergence in s6 where:
- BaseModel would transition to s1 after unsharing (proper access revocation)
- StateFuzzing transitions to s6 where: 
  - User2 retains KS:["user2|remote|DeviceControl"]
  - DeviceControl action remains successful
This indicates the system fails to invalidate existing sessions/credentials after privilege revocation.
