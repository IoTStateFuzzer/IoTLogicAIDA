State | Semantic Description  
-----|-----  
0 | Initial state: No devices added, no sharing operations performed.  
1 | Device added by user1. User1 has full control, no sharing exists.  
2 | Error/Invalid state (transient state for failed operations).  
3 | Device shared by user1 (SharePlug action), awaiting user2's acceptance.  
4 | User2 has accepted the share (AcceptDeviceShare), legitimate control permissions granted.  
5 | User2 performed DeviceControl after share revocation (UnsharePlug). **Critical anomaly**: Attacker retains control capability despite revocation.  
6 | user1 revoked sharing (UnsharePlug) from state5. **Vulnerable state**: user2 still has active DeviceControl permissions.  
7 | Re-shared state after revocation (user1 re-executed SharePlug). Shows possible re-sharing loopholes.  
8 | Device removed by user1. All permissions revoked, but attacker's API attempts reveal error messages (potential info leakage).  

# Critical Vulnerability Report  
## Vulnerability 1: Persistent Access After Permission Revocation  
**Threat Level**: High Risk  

**Attack Path**:  
1. Attacker accumulates device control capability through legitimate sharing acceptance  
2. Replay DeviceControl action after permission revocation  
3. Bypass access control checks to maintain device control  

**Repeat Steps**:  
1. From s0: user1|local|AddDevice ➔ s1  
2. user1|local|SharePlug ➔ s3  
3. user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare ➔ s4  
4. user2|remote|DeviceControl ➔ s5 (legitimate initial control)  
5. user1|local|UnsharePlug ➔ s6  
6. **Exploit**: user2|remote|DeviceControl ➔ s6 (still succeeds)  

**Vulnerability Analysis**:  
The statefuzzing model shows abnormal persistence in states 5-6-7:  
1. In basemodel: UnsharePlug in s4 ➔ s1 (full permission revocation)  
2. In statefuzzing: UnsharePlug in s5 ➔ s6 where:  
   - user2|remote|DeviceControl remains valid (self-loop to s6)  
   - Subsequent user1|local|SharePlug ➔ s7 creates new attack surface  

This violates the CIA triad through:  
1. **Integrity Failure**: Unauthorized control persists after permission revocation  
2. **Availability Risk**: Attacker maintains ability to toggle device states  
3. **Information Disclosure**: Success responses leak device existence/status  

## Vulnerability 2: Replay Attack Surface Expansion  
**Threat Level**: Medium Risk  

**Attack Path**:  
1. Attacker stores DeviceControl API call during legitimate access  
2. Replays command after device re-binding  
3. Gains control without fresh authorization  

**Repeat Steps**:  
1. Complete Vulnerability 1 steps to reach s6  
2. user1|local|AddDevice ➔ s8→s6  
3. **Exploit**: user2|remote|DeviceControl ➔ s6 (controls re-added device)  

**Vulnerability Analysis**:  
The s6→s6 transition after device re-addition demonstrates:  
1. KS (Knowledge Set) retention enables historical API replay  
2. Lack of binding between device instance and authorization  
3. Time-independent permission validation  

**Recommended Fixes**:  
1. Implement strict session binding for device control operations  
2. Introduce generation counters for share/unshare cycles  
3. Server-side state validation before executing control commands  
4. Unified error responses for revoked/non-existent devices
