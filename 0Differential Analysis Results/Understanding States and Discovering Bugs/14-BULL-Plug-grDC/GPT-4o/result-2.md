# States Semantic Mapping table

State | Semantic Description
-----|---------
s0 | Initial state. The system has not yet performed any device addition or sharing operations.
s1 | User1 has added a device. User1 has full control over the device.
s2 | This state represents an error or an invalid operation state where no valid transitions can be performed.
s3 | Device added by User1. User1 successfully shares the device with User2.
s4 | User2 has accepted the device share and has control over the device.
s5 | User2 is controlling the device.
s6 | User1 has revoked the sharing of the device. User2 can no longer control the device.
s7 | User1 has successfully re-shared the device after unsharing previously.
s8 | User1 removed the device and added it back. User2's previous control permissions have been revoked.

# Critical Vulnerability Report
## Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Device Control by Replay
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. User1 shares the device with User2.
2. User2 accumulates knowledge through the successful knowledge share and controlling the device.
3. User1 unshares the device with User2 (reaches state s6).
4. User2 replays the DeviceControl action from state s4 in state s6 and successfully controls the device without explicit re-authorization.

**Repeat Steps**:
1. Starting from state s0, perform operation "user1|local|AddDevice" to reach state s1.
2. Perform operation "user1|local|SharePlug" to reach state s3.
3. Perform operation "user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare" to reach state s4.
4. Perform "user2|remote|DeviceControl" to confirm User2 can control the device.
5. Perform "user1|local|UnsharePlug" to reach state s6.
6. From state s6, perform operation "user2|remote|DeviceControl" which inappropriately transitions to state s5; User2 is able to control the device without permission.

In summary, the basemodel and statefuzzing models show that there is a scenario where an attacker (User2) can control the device without re-authorization, after User1 has explicitly revoked the sharing rights. This is a critical vulnerability as it bypasses standard access controls and can result in unauthorized device manipulation.
