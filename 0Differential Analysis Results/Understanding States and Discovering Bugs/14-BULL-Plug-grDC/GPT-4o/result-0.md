## State Semantic Mapping Table

Based on the provided statefuzzing state machine, the semantic descriptions for each state are as follows:

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|-----------------------|
| s0    | Initial state: No devices added, no actions possible except adding a device by user1. |
| s1    | Device added by user1: user1 has control over the device and can share/unshare or remove it. |
| s2    | Invalid state: No operations are executable in this state. |
| s3    | Device shared by user1, waiting for user2 to accept the share. User1 can also control the device or unshare it. |
| s4    | Device accepted by user2: Both user1 and user2 can control the device. User1 can also unshare or remove the device. |
| s5    | Similar to s4 but allows further device state changes initiated by user2.|
| s6    | Device unshared by user1 from state s5, switching to a new state where user2 has lost control. User1 can share again or remove the device. |
| s7    | Device shared again by user1 after previous unshare, with user2 accepting the share again, similar to s4 but from s6. |
| s8    | Device removed by user1, returning to an initial state: No devices added, user2 action to control device is rejected. |

## Checking for Problems in Basemodel
Upon comparison and analysis of the basemodel, the logic appears correct. It represents expected business logic without discrepancies.

## Security Analysis of StateFuzzing Model

### Critical Vulnerability Report
Everything is OK.

The state transitions in the statefuzzing model do not indicate any critical vulnerabilities or privacy concerns. The state changes and attackerâ€™s behavior have been consistent with the permissions and constraints applied. No unintended privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or information leakage has been observed. The operations follow a predictable pattern and revert to legitimate states where necessary without compromising the user's security.

All transition differences can be justified based on the attacker's knowledge set, natural UI behaviors, and consistent application responses.
