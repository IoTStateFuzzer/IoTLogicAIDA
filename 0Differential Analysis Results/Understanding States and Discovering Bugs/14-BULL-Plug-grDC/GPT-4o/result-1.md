# State Semantic mapping table and Analysis

## State Semantic Mapping Table: statefuzzing

State | Semantic Description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state.
1 | Device added by user1.
2 | Inactive state, no operations can be performed.
3 | User1 shared the device with user2.
4 | User2 accepted the device share from user1.
5 | User2 controls the device.
6 | User1 unshares the device successfully.
7 | User1 shares the device again after unsharing.
8 | Device removed by user1; returns to the previous state based on previous operations.

## Analysis of Basemodel

The `basemodel` appears to function properly, with transitions that correctly reflect expected smart home device and user permission management logic. The flow of events such as adding, sharing, and unsharing devices, and the responses to these actions, is handled correctly and follows logical sequences.

## Analysis of Statefuzzing

The `statefuzzing` model introduces additional complexity and scenarios, including possible actions and knowledge replays by an attacker (user2). The key differences compared to the `basemodel` are:

1. Added states s5, s6, s7, and s8 which represent scenarios where user2 has control over the device and subsequent unshare operations.
2. Transitions reflecting attacker actions and retries.

## Critical Vulnerability Report

**Everything is OK**: After thoroughly analyzing both state machines, `basemodel` and `statefuzzing`, no vulnerabilities that violate the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) or expose logical flaws which may affect security and privacy have been found. The state transitions in `statefuzzing` that differ from `basemodel` do not give user2 any unauthorized access or control, as proper checks and balances are in place to prevent misuse.

### Summary of Analysis Process:
1. Compared each state and corresponding transition between `basemodel` and `statefuzzing`.
2. Verified the semantics of each state transition.
3. Checked for possible security issues such as unauthorized access, information leakage, or privilege escalation based on attacker knowledge set and replays.
4. Confirmed that operations behave deterministically and return to a secure state even in attacker scenario.

Thus, the security model holds up well and does not exhibit any exploitable behavior based on provided data.
