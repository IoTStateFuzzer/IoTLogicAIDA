# State Semantic mapping table
|State | semantic description|
|-----|---------|
|0 | Indicates the initial status|
|1 | User1 has bound the device (plug)|
|2 | Error state where no operations can be performed successfully|
|3 | User1 has shared the plug with user2, both have control permissions|
|4 | User1 has shared the plug with user2, both have control permissions, and user2 has knowledge to perform remote control via API hooking|
|5 | User1 has unshared the plug, user2 has knowledge but no control permissions, can attempt remote control via API hooking but will fail|
|6 | User1 has removed the device, user2 has knowledge but no control permissions, can attempt remote control via API hooking but will fail|

# Base model report
Every thing is OK.

# Divergent model report
Every thing is OK.

In the base model, the state transitions are consistent with the expected operations and permissions. In the divergent model, despite the attacker's attempts to use their knowledge to control the device remotely, the system correctly handles these attempts by either allowing them when permissions are valid or denying them when permissions are not present. Thus, there are no security vulnerabilities or logical flaws in the divergent model based on the provided state transitions and operations.
