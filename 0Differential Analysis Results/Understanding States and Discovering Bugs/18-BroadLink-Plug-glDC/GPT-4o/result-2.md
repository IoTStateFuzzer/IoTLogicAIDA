# State Semantic Mapping Table for `statefuzzing` Model:

| **State** | **Semantic Description** |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **s0**    | Initial state, no device or control permissions granted to either user. |
| **s1**    | User1 can add devices, User2 cannot control any devices. |
| **s2**    | User1 can manage devices, but no permissions for User2 to control devices. |
| **s3**    | User1 can manage devices, but User2 has no device control permissions. |
| **s4**    | User1 can add or remove devices; User2 can only accept an invitation, but no device control yet. |
| **s5**    | User1 can manage devices; User2 has successfully accepted an invitation to the home and has limited access to shared device control. |
| **s6**    | User1 can manage devices; User2 has accepted the invitation but is restricted to limited device control (no permanent permissions). |
| **s7**    | User1 can control devices; User2 has successfully gained access to control devices through shared permissions. |
| **s8**    | User1 can manage devices; User2 can control devices through valid access. |
| **s9**    | User1 can control devices; User2 may attempt control but fails due to lack of valid permissions. |
| **s10**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 is in the process of joining the home and can control shared devices. |
| **s11**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 has access to shared devices but can't modify device states. |
| **s12**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 still lacks full control over devices, as only shared permissions are available. |
| **s13**   | User1 manages devices; User2 has partial control based on invitation, restricted actions. |
| **s14**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 is still restricted to shared device control without permanent permissions. |
| **s15**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 has the ability to control shared devices but cannot modify configurations. |
| **s16**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 has some device control capabilities but lacks certain critical operations. |
| **s17**   | User1 has full control over devices; User2 attempts but fails to control devices or perform certain operations. |
| **s18**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 can control devices through temporary shared permissions. |
| **s19**   | User1 controls devices; User2 has been temporarily granted control but lacks permanent control rights. |
| **s20**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 can control shared devices but lacks broader control rights. |
| **s21**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 successfully controls devices, but limitations exist based on shared permissions. |
| **s22**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 has only temporary control through shared device permissions. |
| **s23**   | User1 can manage devices; User2's access is limited, with attempts to control devices being restricted. |
| **s24**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 is in the process of re-entering the family group and can control shared devices. |
| **s25**   | User1 manages devices; User2 has limited access to devices but cannot modify configurations. |
| **s26**   | User1 has full control; User2 may attempt actions but will fail due to restricted access. |
| **s27**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 is able to attempt but cannot succeed in controlling devices due to restricted permissions. |
| **s28**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 has limited device control via shared permissions. |
| **s29**   | User1 can manage devices; User2 can control devices temporarily but lacks permanent access. |
| **s30**   | User1 manages devices; User2 has the ability to control devices under specific conditions. |
| **s31**   | User1 controls devices; User2 has attempted actions but is restricted in their access. |
| **s32**   | User1 has full control; User2 attempts but is restricted from certain operations. |

# Vulnerability Report

## **Critical Vulnerability Report**
There are no significant vulnerabilities detected in the `statefuzzing` model. The system seems robust against unauthorized device control, and the temporary permissions granted to User2 do not lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to User1â€™s devices. All operations return appropriate failure states when an attacker attempts to bypass restrictions using replay attacks.

However, it is important to check for **information leakage** in shared control states (especially when User2 has temporary access to devices), ensuring that no unauthorized information is disclosed to User2. No vulnerabilities were observed in the current state transitions that would impact user security or privacy.

## **Final Verdict**:
Everything is OK.
