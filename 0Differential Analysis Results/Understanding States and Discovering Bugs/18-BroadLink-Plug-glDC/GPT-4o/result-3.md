# State Semantic Mapping Table for Statefuzzing

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0    | Initial state where user1 has not added any devices or shared any permissions. |
| s1    | User1 has added a device locally; no control permissions granted to user2. |
| s2    | User1 can control devices locally and remotely. User2 cannot perform any actions. |
| s3    | User1 has invited user2 to the home, and user2 is awaiting to accept the invite. User2 cannot control any devices yet. |
| s4    | User1 has successfully invited user2 to the home. User2 is awaiting to accept the invitation. |
| s5    | User1 has successfully invited user2 and can manage devices. User2 cannot control any devices. |
| s6    | User1 has control over devices and can invite user2. User2 has no control over any devices but can still interact with the system. |
| s7    | User2 has control over devices and can accept the invitation. User1 has no control over devices. |
| s8    | User2 has accepted the invitation and has some permissions. |
| s9    | User2 has control over the devices after accepting the invitation. User1 can add or remove devices. |
| s10   | User2 successfully invited and added to the home. User2 can control the devices, but user1 can remove or control the devices. |
| s11   | User2 has received an invitation and is in the process of being added, but control over devices is not granted. |
| s12   | User2 cannot perform any actions, and user1 controls all devices. |
| s13   | User2 is in a state where they can interact with devices, and user1 can still manage devices. |
| s14   | User1 can control all devices. User2 has temporary control over some devices. |
| s15   | User2 has the ability to control devices, and user1 has full control. |
| s16   | User2 is in a state where they can interact with devices, but their control is temporarily revoked. |
| s17   | User2 has lost control over devices, but user1 still holds all permissions. |
| s18   | User1 can manage devices, and user2 is unable to control any devices. |
| s19   | User2 does not have control over devices, and user1 retains full control. |
| s20   | User2 can control devices, but user1 retains the ability to manage device settings. |
| s21   | User2 has lost access to devices but retains permission to interact with the system. |
| s22   | User1 can invite user2 to control devices but user2 cannot perform actions immediately. |
| s23   | User2 can temporarily control devices based on prior actions, but permissions are limited. |
| s24   | User2 is fully granted control, and user1 can manage permissions and devices. |
| s25   | User2 has full control, and user1 retains permission to manage devices. |
| s26   | User2 has been invited and has limited device access. |
| s27   | User2 has control permissions temporarily revoked. |
| s28   | User2 can now control devices, but their privileges are restricted after a temporary removal. |
| s29   | User2 has control over devices again after previous permissions were revoked. |
| s30   | User2 has control over devices, but the invitation status is being processed. |
| s31   | User2 has limited control and can only interact with certain devices based on the permissions granted. |
| s32   | User2 has full control over devices, and user1 can remove permissions as needed. |

# Vulnerability Report

# Critical Vulnerability Report

**Vulnerability 1: Temporary Loss of Control During Transition States**
- **Threat Level**: High Risk
- **Attack Path**:
  1. Attacker accumulates knowledge of operations via normal system interactions, such as performing valid actions to control devices (e.g., "user2|local|DeviceControl").
  2. Replay the **"user2|local|DeviceControl"** action in states like s5, s7, and s9.
  3. The attacker bypasses the permission checks to gain unauthorized control over devices in certain transition states, such as after invitations are accepted or when permissions are temporarily revoked.
  
- **Repeat Steps**:
  - Start from state s0, where user1 has no devices added.
  - Perform an operation like **"user1|local|AddDevice"** and transition to state s1.
  - Move through intermediate states, e.g., s7 or s9, where the attacker gains control temporarily due to gaps in permission checks during transitions.
