# State Semantic Mapping Table for Statefuzzing

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0    | Initial state, no devices added, no users invited. User2 has no permissions. |
| s1    | Device added by user1, no control for user2 yet. User1 can control devices locally. |
| s2    | User1 can perform basic device control operations locally, but no permissions for user2 yet. User2 has no control rights. |
| s3    | User1 has added a device and invited user2, who has not yet accepted the invitation. |
| s4    | User1 has invited user2, and user2 has received the invitation, but not yet accepted it. |
| s5    | User1 has invited user2, and user2 has accepted the invitation and joined the family group, gaining control permissions over devices. |
| s6    | User1 can perform device control locally and manage devices, while user2 can also control devices remotely. |
| s7    | User1 can control devices remotely, user2 can click on the UI but not perform certain actions. |
| s8    | User1 can perform operations, user2 can interact with devices but is restricted. |
| s9    | User1 still has full device control; user2 has no permissions. |
| s10   | User1 invites user2 again; user2 remains without permissions. |
| s11   | User2's ability to interact with the UI is limited by permission, user2 canâ€™t perform certain actions directly. |
| s12   | User1's actions are still executable, user2 still has no control over the devices. |
| s13   | User1 has invited user2, who can accept the invitation to control the devices legally. |
| s14   | User1 can perform full device control, user2 can rejoin and accept invitations. |
| s15   | User2 has gained limited local control over the devices but lacks full permission. |
| s16   | User2 has limited control but cannot perform full actions, error states for user2 in some operations. |
| s17   | User2 can perform some operations with failures in others, such as failed scans. |
| s18   | User2 can control devices, but there are issues with certain actions that cause failures. |
| s19   | User2 continues to face restricted operations and encounters failures in some actions. |
| s20   | User1 maintains control, but user2 is restricted from full access to certain device operations. |
| s21   | User2 continues to face failure in operations but is still able to interact with devices intermittently. |
| s22   | User1 maintains full control, and user2 has intermittent issues with certain operations. |
| s23   | User2 continues to face operational failures and is limited in their ability to perform actions. |
| s24   | User2's control is limited by failures in performing actions and restrictions in certain commands. |
| s25   | User1 retains full control, user2 faces restricted access and failure in some operations. |
| s26   | User2's control is limited and faces failures, with some commands failing or returning empty results. |
| s27   | User2 faces continuous failures, and operations are highly restricted, though some commands may succeed. |
| s28   | User2 can interact with devices locally, but certain remote operations continue to fail. |
| s29   | User2 maintains limited access, facing restrictions on some operations and full failure in others. |
| s30   | User2 has limited permissions to perform some actions, but faces restrictions and failures in others. |
| s31   | User2 experiences failures in some actions, while user1 maintains full control. |
| s32   | User2 faces persistent failures in remote actions, while user1 retains full control and access. |

# Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Control after User2 Rejoins Family

**Threat Level**: Medium Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker (user2) can gain knowledge about control actions via local access to devices after being invited.
2. Attacker replays or interacts with devices in the family group.
3. By exploiting limited permissions, attacker can bypass certain checks and retain temporary control even after quitting home and rejoining.

**Repeat Steps**:
1. Start from state s4, where user1 invites user2.
2. Move to state s5 when user2 accepts the invitation and joins the family.
3. State transition to s15 when user2 gains limited device control.
4. User2 reattempts interactions with devices, potentially leading to unauthorized control through minimal actions.
