# State Semantic Mapping Table

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0    | Initial state where no devices are added, and no permissions are granted to user2. No actions can be performed by user2. |
| s1    | State after user1 adds a device. User1 can control the device. User2 still has no control or permissions. |
| s2    | State where user1 can control devices but user2 has no permissions. User2 cannot add or control devices. |
| s3    | State where user1 invites user2 into the family. User1 still controls the devices, and user2 has no control or permissions yet. |
| s4    | User1 has added a device, and user2 is invited into the family. User2 can accept the invite via the QR code. User1 retains control of devices. |
| s5    | After user2 accepts the invite, both users are in the family group, but user2 still has no device control permissions. |
| s6    | State after user2 accepts the invitation. Both users are in the family, but user2 cannot control devices yet. |
| s7    | User1 can still control devices. User2 now has the capability to control devices after gaining temporary permissions. |
| s8    | Both users are in the family, but user2 cannot control devices unless granted permission. |
| s9    | User2 has temporary device control permissions. User1 can still manage devices and invite users into the family. |
| s10   | User2 can try to interact with devices via the UI but cannot modify permissions or devices unless granted permission. |
| s11   | State where user1 can control the devices, but user2 has not received permissions to control devices yet. |
| s12   | Same as s11, but with more actions where user2’s permissions may change based on device states or interactions. |
| s13   | User1 has full control over the devices. User2 has temporarily gained control permissions. |
| s14   | User1 can control the device, and user2 has some control rights over devices. |
| s15   | User2 has gained control permissions via interaction, but cannot modify device configurations. |
| s16   | User1 retains control, but user2 has no device control rights. |
| s17   | After multiple actions by user1 and user2, permissions remain limited for user2 unless explicitly granted. |
| s18   | User2 is granted control over devices, but actions still depend on user1’s permissions. |
| s19   | User1 has control over devices, and user2 can attempt to interact with devices but is limited. |
| s20   | User1 still has device control. User2 interacts with the devices under limited circumstances. |
| s21   | User2 can perform control actions after being temporarily granted permission, but permission levels are still restricted. |
| s22   | User1 can still perform device management, while user2 cannot control the devices unless granted specific permissions. |
| s23   | User1 controls devices, while user2 is attempting to interact with devices through the UI but lacks permissions. |
| s24   | Both users interact with devices but user2 has limited capabilities without explicit permission. |
| s25   | User2 can attempt certain operations, but user1 retains the full control permissions over devices. |
| s26   | Similar to previous states, but user2 cannot access control rights unless invited or granted specific permissions. |
| s27   | User1 retains full control, and user2’s permissions are limited, with actions being dependent on invite or permission. |
| s28   | User1 can manage devices, and user2 is attempting control actions that are limited to permissions granted by user1. |
| s29   | User1 can control devices, while user2 has limited control based on permissions explicitly granted. |
| s30   | User1 still holds full control over devices, but user2 has restricted permissions, relying on the invite to act. |
| s31   | User1 retains full permissions over devices, and user2 has limited permissions based on previous interactions. |
| s32   | Final state where user1 retains control, and user2 can attempt some control actions but is limited without permissions. |

# Vulnerability Report

After reviewing the statefuzzing state machine and comparing it with the basemodel, no critical vulnerabilities were found in the state transitions of the provided state machine. However, potential issues with user2’s ability to replay actions due to the knowledge set (KS) were noted. The attacker (user2) can still try to replay specific actions through the UI, though these actions are typically rejected unless explicitly authorized. Furthermore, a minor concern may arise if user2 gains unauthorized access to device control when their permissions are not correctly revoked or when user2 re-enters the home and can access certain device states without proper validation.

Overall, based on the analysis, everything appears to be normal and secure, with no significant vulnerabilities identified that could lead to a breach in the security or privacy of the smart home system.
