# State Semantic Mapping Table for Statefuzzing

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0    | Initial state. User1 is the owner, no devices added, and User2 has no permissions or control over any devices. |
| s1    | User1 has successfully added a device. User2 still has no device control permissions. |
| s2    | No devices available. User1 cannot perform actions such as adding/removing devices. User2 still has no permissions. |
| s3    | User1 invited User2 into the home; User2 has not yet accepted the invitation. |
| s4    | User1 invited User2 successfully. User2 can accept the invitation, but has no device control permissions yet. |
| s5    | User2 successfully accepted the invitation but does not yet have device control permissions. |
| s6    | User2 has accepted the invitation and now has temporary device control permissions over shared devices, but only those that User1 has shared. |
| s7    | User2 has device control permissions for the shared devices and can now interact with them locally. |
| s8    | User2 still has device control permissions. User1 can continue managing devices, and User2 can control the shared devices. |
| s9    | User1 can add and remove devices, while User2 cannot control devices. |
| s10   | User1 can manage devices, while User2 remains restricted to controlling only shared devices. |
| s11   | User2 can attempt to control devices, but may face failures depending on the device's configuration or permissions. |
| s12   | User1 invited User2 again. User2 can accept the invitation but has no control over devices unless explicitly shared. |
| s13   | User2 has device control permissions temporarily. User1 can manage devices, but User2's permissions are limited. |
| s14   | User2 successfully accepted the invitation. User2 can control shared devices but does not have permissions to add or remove devices. |
| s15   | User2 can control shared devices and make local interactions but has no permanent access to all devices unless re-invited. |
| s16   | User2's device control permissions are restricted, and any actions like adding/removing devices will fail. |
| s17   | User2’s device control is restricted. User1 can add devices, and User2 can try to interact, but the system will prevent certain actions. |
| s18   | User2 continues to have limited control over devices. User1 maintains full control. |
| s19   | User2's actions are limited, with some permissions revoked. User1 can still manage devices, and User2’s actions may be unsuccessful. |
| s20   | User2 can attempt to interact with devices, but any failure in action triggers an error message, indicating a lack of permission. |
| s21   | User2 has limited control and may face frequent access issues. User1 manages devices with full control. |
| s22   | User2 can attempt to interact with devices, but is often blocked from accessing or controlling devices outside shared permissions. |
| s23   | User2's interaction with devices remains highly restricted. User1 manages permissions and device actions. |
| s24   | User2 faces access restrictions. User1 has control and can manage devices or revoke permissions as needed. |
| s25   | User2 can still perform some limited actions. User1 can add/remove devices, and User2’s permissions are periodically tested. |
| s26   | User2 experiences periodic access issues while trying to control devices. Permissions remain restricted without explicit invitations or device sharing. |
| s27   | User2 has restricted access and can only interact with devices if specifically shared. User1 continues to manage devices. |
| s28   | User2’s permissions remain restricted, and most device control actions fail unless explicitly permitted. |
| s29   | User2 can interact with some devices but cannot control them fully. Permissions continue to be governed by User1’s sharing. |
| s30   | User2 can attempt interactions but faces periodic failures due to lack of permissions. User1 retains complete control. |
| s31   | User2’s access to devices is further limited, and attempts to control them are blocked unless re-invited. |
| s32   | User2 is highly restricted in their interactions with devices. User1 retains full control and can remove or add devices. |

# Critical Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1: Privilege Escalation via Unauthorized Invitation Acceptance
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker (user2) can accumulate knowledge of valid invitation actions through interactions, storing valid QR codes.
2. The attacker can replay the action of accepting an invitation in states where permissions are granted to user2.
3. By re-accepting the invitation in unauthorized states, the attacker may regain control over shared devices that they should no longer have access to.

**Repeat steps**:
Starting from state s4, user2 can use the knowledge of "user2|remote|AcceptInvite" to transition into a state where they regain control over shared devices, even after their permissions have been revoked.

The statefuzzing model is now analyzed and the vulnerability identified involves unauthorized escalation of control permissions.
