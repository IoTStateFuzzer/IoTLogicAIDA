# State Semantic Mapping Table

| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| s0    | Initial state. No user actions have been performed. Both user1 and user2 have limited device control permissions (noElement). |
| s1    | User1 has successfully added a device. User2 still has no permissions. |
| s2    | User1 and User2 have no valid permissions for any actions (noElement). |
| s3    | User1 has successfully invited user2 to the home. The invitation process was completed successfully. User2 still has no permissions. |
| s4    | User1 has added a device. User2 has no permissions, and an invitation has been extended to user2. |
| s5    | User1 has added a device. User2 has successfully accepted the invitation. Both users can now control devices. |
| s6    | User1 has invited user2 again to the home. User2 has control over devices, but this action may fail due to invalid state transitions (error). |
| s7    | User1 has added a device. User2 has valid device control permissions. However, a failure might occur with user2's QR scan. |
| s8    | User1 has invited user2 again, but there might be issues with user2's permission state during the invitation acceptance. |
| s9    | User1 has added a device, but no relevant permissions have been assigned to user2 for device control. |
| s10   | User1 successfully adds a device. User2 has valid control permissions and can interact with the device as intended. |
| s11   | User1 has added a device. User2 can scan the invitation QR code, though some operations fail due to unknown errors. |
| s12   | User1 has added a device, but permission failures might occur in the transition stages. |
| s13   | User1 has invited user2. The invitation was successful, but permission failures might lead to issues in device control. |
| s14   | User1 has successfully invited user2 again. However, the state machine may experience permission inconsistencies. |
| s15   | User2 has valid control permissions. User2 can interact with the device, but some interactions result in failed operations due to network or application errors. |
| s16   | User2 can interact with the device, but permission validation issues cause specific operations to fail (e.g., QR code scan). |
| s17   | User2 has device control permissions, but failures in the invitation or QR scan process lead to inconsistent states. |
| s18   | User2 has device control permissions, but failures in the interaction process (QR scan failure) disrupt the flow. |
| s19   | User2 has valid control permissions but faces issues with a specific operation that results in failure. |
| s20   | User2 maintains device control permissions despite errors in some processes (e.g., scanning invitation). |
| s21   | User2 successfully interacts with the device but encounters specific errors in the process that disrupt the flow. |
| s22   | User2 has valid permissions to control the device but faces failures in specific actions, such as QR code scanning. |
| s23   | User2 can interact with the device but has limited permissions due to certain restrictions or failures. |
| s24   | User2 has control permissions, but specific operations (QR scanning, invitation acceptance) may fail or be inconsistent. |
| s25   | User2 has device control permissions, but network errors or failures in some actions lead to inconsistencies. |
| s26   | User2 has permissions, but transitions are inconsistent or fail due to the inability to properly execute specific actions. |
| s27   | User2 can interact with devices, but permission issues or failed operations result in unstable system states. |
| s28   | User2 maintains control over devices, but transitions may fail due to invalid states or errors in QR code scanning. |
| s29   | User2 has control permissions, but repeated errors in scanning invitations or device interactions cause inconsistencies. |
| s30   | User2 can interact with the device, but specific permissions may be denied during transitions. |
| s31   | User2 has permissions but encounters errors in scanning or inviting, leading to invalid transitions. |
| s32   | User2 interacts with the device, but transitions may be invalid due to permission errors or failed operations. |

# Critical Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1: Temporary Control Permissions for User2
**Threat Level**: Medium Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. User2 gains temporary device control permissions through the invitation process.
2. User2 then performs a "ScanQRCode" operation, successfully adding themselves as a family member.
3. After removing user2's permissions or quitting the home, user2 can still access device control, leading to potential information leakage if they try to re-scan or manipulate devices after being removed from the home.

**Repeat Steps**:
Starting from state s5, perform "ScanQRCode" to reach state s6, where user2 maintains device control despite the invalidation of their permissions.

---

# Summary of Findings:
- No critical vulnerabilities detected in the basic flow of actions.
- There is a potential vulnerability in cases where user2 retains device control after being removed from the home, leading to possible unauthorized access to device controls.
