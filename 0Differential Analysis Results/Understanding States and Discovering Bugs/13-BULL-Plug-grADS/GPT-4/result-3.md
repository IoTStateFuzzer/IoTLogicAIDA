# State Semantic mapping table
State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Indicates the initial status, there is no device to control.
1 | User 1 has added a device. User 1 can control the device, but user 2 cannot because the control has not been shared with them yet.
2 | An invalid condition, no operation can be performed to this state.
3 | User 1 has shared the device control. User 2 can now accept the device share request. User 1 also able to control the device. 
4 | User 2 has accepted the device share successfully. Both users have now control of the device.
5 | User 1 has unshared the device with user 2, now only user 1 can control the device.
6 | User 1 has removed the device. Neither user can control the device because it does not exist.
7 | User 1 has shared the device control after unsharing. User 2 can accept a share request.


# basemodel analysis
1. The logic is perfect because all states transition as expected and there are no invalid conditions or dead ends that can cause problems. The important thing to note is that the device has to be added before it can be shared, and sharing has to happen before accepting the share. All the share controls are only initiated by user 1, thus security is guaranteed.

# statefuzzing analysis
From the statefuzzing model, we can observe a couple of things that are worth noting.
1. The attacker can replay the "user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare". This means that even if user 1 unshares the device with user 2 (like in state s5), the attacker can try to replay the accept share which is a risk. However, it results in an operation failure since the attacker is not allowed to execute this operation. Hence, this is not security violation and accepted as a part of the system design.
2. Similarly, if the device is removed by user 1 before user 2 accepts the share (like in state s6), the attacker can also attempt to accept the share. But this will again result in an operation failure as the device does not exist. Therefore, it is also not a security risk.
3. In the state s7, user 1 shares the control after unsharing it. In this state, even if user 2 attempts to replay the "user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare", it would actually be a valid action since the share was initiated by user 1.
 
Overall, there is no critical vulnerabilities found in this model. The attacker can still attempt replay attacks, but they never succeed due to the controls put in place by the system. There's also no information leakage, since in all states it will be impossible for the attacker to retrieve any meaningful data without proper authorization.
