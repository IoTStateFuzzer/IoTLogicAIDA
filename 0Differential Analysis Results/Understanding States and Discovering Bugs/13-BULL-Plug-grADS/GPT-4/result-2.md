State Semantic mapping table
============

State | Semantic description
----|-------------------
s0 | This state represents that user1 has not added any devices yet. User1 can only add devices. User2 doesn't have any valid actions to perform in this state.
s1 | Indicates that user1 has added a device and has control over it. Even though the device is added, user2 still does not have the authority to control the device.
s2 | User1 only has the device, however no sharing has been done. User2 can't perform any operations because there are no devices shared with them.
s3 | This state denotes that user1 shared the control of the device with user2 but user2 hasn't accepted the control yet.
s4 | Both users have the control over the device after user2 accepted the device share. User 2 can use it normally.
s5 | It means that user2's permission is returned by user1 after user2 obtained the temporary permission of the device. But user2 still has the ability to replay. 
s6 | This state signifies user1 has removed the device thereby no actions currently can be done by user1 or user2.
s7 | User1 has another device and it is shared with the user2. User2 hasn't accepted the control yet. It resembles state s3, but it shows that user2 has the ability to replay to gain access to the undo revoked device control.

Looking at the transition diagram of each state, we can see that the operations of each state in basemodel are quite consistent with the operations of each state in statefuzzing. The only operations user2 can try to replay in is from state s4, however user2 can't succesfully replay or manipulate the commands. For example, in state s3, statefuzzing allows user2 to replay "user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare" action, but user2 can't obtain any unauthorized control or information leakage, because this state change also exists in basemodel and it's completely normal behavior. 

Conclusion
===========
There is no apparent vulnerability in the comparisons between the basemodel and the statefuzzing model provided. This is because User2 in any state either performs legitimate actions, or attempts to replay an operation but the system rejects it, so User2 doesn't gain any unanticipated authorizations or accesses of any device. Hence, the security and privacy of users are protected.
