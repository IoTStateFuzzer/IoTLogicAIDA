State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: user1 can add devices, no permissions for user2
1 | Device added by user1: user1 can share/control/remove device, user2 has no access
2 | Invalid state (error condition): No operations succeed here
3 | Device shared by user1: user2 can accept share via UI, user1 can unshare/control
4 | Share accepted by user2: user2 has valid control, user1 can unshare/remove device
5 | Share revoked (via UnsharePlug): user2's permissions revoked, user1 can reshare
6 | Device removed: Clean state similar to s0 but with attacker's KS retained
7 | Re-shared state after revocation: Same permissions as s3 but different state context

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Invalid State Transition After Device Re-addition
**Threat Level**: Medium Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker retains knowledge of device sharing after device removal
2. User1 re-adds device creating new device context
3. Attacker attempts to replay old sharing credentials

**Repeat Steps**:
1. s0 → s1 (AddDevice)
2. s1 → s3 (SharePlug)
3. s3 → s4 (user2 accepts share)
4. s4 → s6 (user1 removes device)
5. s6 → s5 (user1 re-adds device)
6. In s5: Attacker replays AcceptDeviceShare → remains in s5 with failure

**Analysis**:
While the system correctly rejects the replay attempt, the preserved knowledge set (KS) in state s5 creates an invalid state transition pattern. The retention of obsolete sharing credentials in KS after device removal violates the "fail-secure" principle, though no actual access is granted.

## Vulnerability 2: Control Persistence After Unshare
**Threat Level**: Low Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. User1 unshares device while user2 has active control session
2. State transition to s5 doesn't immediately revoke MQTT connections
3. Brief window for command injection through retained MQTT messages

**Repeat Steps**:
1. s0 → s1 → s3 → s4 (normal sharing flow)
2. s4 → s5 (user1 unshares)
3. Attacker sends rapid MQTT commands during transition delay

**Analysis**:
The state machine shows user2|remote|DeviceControl in s5 correctly transitions to s2 (NoElement), but real-world MQTT implementations might allow brief command execution during state transition periods due to asynchronous communication delays.

**Recommendations**:
1. Implement strict session invalidation during UnsharePlug operations
2. Add MQTT command validation tied to current sharing state
3. Clear knowledge set entries related to revoked shares during device removal
