State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: No devices added, no permissions granted
1 | Device added by user1, no sharing initiated
2 | Invalid state (operations unavailable)
3 | Device shared by user1, pending user2 acceptance
4 | Device share accepted by user2 - user2 has control permissions
5 | Share revoked by user1 (via UnsharePlug) - user2's permissions removed
6 | Device removed by user1 - system reset to empty state (with KS remnants)
7 | New sharing initiated after revocation - valid share available

# Critical Vulnerability report
**No critical vulnerabilities detected**

**Analysis Summary**:
1. All state transitions in statefuzzing maintain CIA triad principles:
   - *Confidentiality*: No information leakage detected in error responses
   - *Integrity*: Attacker replay attempts fail after permission revocation (s5 stays on failed AcceptDeviceShare)
   - *Availability*: Legitimate control recovery requires fresh user1 sharing action

2. Key difference analysis:
   - s4→s5 transition (vs basemodel's s4→s1) tracks attacker's KS without granting privileges
   - s6→s5 device re-addition properly resets ownership without restoring old shares
   - s7 state represents valid re-sharing lifecycle management

3. Attacker capability limitations:
   - KS persistence (s5/s6) doesn't enable privilege escalation
   - All successful attacks require UI-clickable actions with user1 consent
   - API replay attempts consistently fail after permission revocation

**Recommendation**: Maintain current state machine design with periodic KS cleanup in device removal operations.
