State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: No devices added, no users invited. User1 can add devices.
1 | Device added by User1. User1 can share, control, or remove the device. User2 has no access.
2 | Error/Invalid state: Operations not applicable (e.g., attempting to control non-existent device).
3 | Device shared by User1 (share initiated). User2 can click to accept the share via UI.
4 | Device share accepted by User2. User2 has legitimate control permissions. User1 can unshare/remove device.
5 | Share revoked by User1 (after being in s4). User2's control attempts are blocked. User1 can re-share device.
6 | Device removed by User1 (from s4/s5). User1 must re-add device to regain functionality. User2 has no access.
7 | Device re-shared by User1 (from s5). User2 can accept new share via UI to regain access.

# Critical Vulnerability report
No critical vulnerabilities detected in the statefuzzing model. All state transitions properly handle permission revocation and replay attacks by maintaining strict access control. Attacker replay attempts in non-clickable states result in operation failures without privilege escalation or information leakage.
