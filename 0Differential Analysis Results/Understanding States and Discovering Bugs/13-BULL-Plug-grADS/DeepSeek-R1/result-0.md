State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: No devices added. User1 can add a device.
1 | Device added by User1. User1 can share device/control/remove.
2 | Error state: Invalid operations attempted.
3 | Device shared by User1. User2 can accept share via UI.
4 | User2 accepted share. Both users have control permissions.
5 | User1 unshared device. User2's access revoked but retains replay capability.
6 | Device removed by User1. System returns to initial setup.
7 | User1 re-shared device after unsharing. User2 can accept via replay.

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Persistent Access Through Replay Attack
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker accumulates AcceptDeviceShare operation knowledge during legitimate sharing
2. After being unshared, attacker replays AcceptDeviceShare operation
3. Regains device control permissions despite revocation

**Repeat Steps**:
1. s0 → s1 (User1 adds device)
2. s1 → s3 (User1 shares device)
3. s3 → s4 (User2 legitimately accepts share)
4. s4 → s5 (User1 unshares device)
5. s5 → s7 (User1 re-shares device)
6. s7 → s4 (User2 replays AcceptDeviceShare from KS)

**Impact Analysis**:
After legitimate device sharing (s3→s4), attacker's KS stores AcceptDeviceShare operation. When User1:
1. Unshares device (s4→s5)
2. Re-shares device (s5→s7)

Attacker can replay stored AcceptDeviceShare to return to s4 with full control permissions. This violates authorization controls by allowing:
- Re-acquisition of privileges without fresh invitation
- Bypass of proper sharing workflow
- Persistent access despite revocation

**Root Cause**:
Statefuzzing fails to invalidate previous sharing credentials after unshare operation. The system allows historical AcceptDeviceShare operations to remain valid after re-sharing.
