State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state: No devices added. User1 can add devices. All other operations fail.
1 | Device added by user1. User1 can share device, remove device, or control it. User2 has no valid actions.
2 | Error/Invalid state. All operations return failures.
3 | Device shared by user1. User2 can legally accept the share through UI (Clickable). Attacker knowledge set (KS) remains empty as this is a fresh share.
4 | User2 has successfully accepted device share. User1 can unshare, remove device, or control it. User2 retains KS entry for AcceptDeviceShare but can't click it (Clickable empty). User2 can control device.
5 | User1 unshared device from state4. User1 can reshare, remove device, or control it. Attacker still has KS entry but replay attempts fail.
6 | Device removed by user1 from state4/s5. User1 can re-add device. User2 actions fail.
7 | User1 re-shared device after unsharing (from s5). Similar to s3 - user2 can accept share via UI (Clickable). KS updated with latest share code.

# Critical Vulnerability report
**No critical vulnerabilities detected**

Validation Summary:
1. All state transitions in statefuzzing maintain CIA triad:
   - **Confidentiality**: Attacker can't access device info after revocation (s5->s2 for DeviceControl)
   - **Integrity**: Replay attacks fail when privileges are revoked (s4/s5 reject AcceptDeviceShare replays)
   - **Availability**: Legitimate users retain full control of lifecycle (add/share/remove)

2. Observed differences from basemodel are knowledge-set tracking mechanisms rather than vulnerabilities:
   - State s5/s7 exist to track attacker's stale knowledge
   - Looped transitions (s3<->s4<->s7) represent valid re-sharing scenarios

3. Attacker capabilities properly constrained:
   - KS entries don't grant new privileges
   - Clickable actions align with legitimate UI workflows
   - API replays fail after permission revocation
