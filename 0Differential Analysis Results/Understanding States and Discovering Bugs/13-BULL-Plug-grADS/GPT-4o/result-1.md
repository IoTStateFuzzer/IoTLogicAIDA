# State Semantic mapping table
State | Semantic Description
-----|---------
0 | Indicates the initial status. No devices are added and no permissions are shared.
1 | User1 has added a device to their account. The device can be controlled and removed by user1.
2 | Indicates an invalid state where attempts to execute actions are not possible because the necessary context or permissions are missing.
3 | User1 has shared the device (plug) with user2. User2 has received the sharing request but not yet accepted or recognized the device control permission.
4 | User1 has shared the device (plug) with user2, and user2 has accepted the sharing request, obtaining control permissions.
5 | User1 has canceled the share permission of the device with user2. User2 no longer has control permissions.
6 | User1 has removed the device from their account. The device is no longer available to either user1 or user2.
7 | User2 accepts the device share again after user1 has canceled and reshared the device. User2 regains control permissions.

** Note on basemodel **: The basemodel's state transitions appear to be logical and consistent in ensuring security and correct permissions handling.

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Inconsistency in State Transition after Unsharing
** Threat Level **: High Risk

** Attack Path **:
1. User1 shares the device (Shared state - s3/s4).
2. User2 accepts the shared device invitation and obtains control permissions (s4).
3. User1 unshares the device (s4 to s5).
4. User1 reshared the device (Transition to s7 occurs improperly based on attacker knowledge set causing inconsistency in permissions).

** Repeat steps **:
1. Start from state s0.
2. Perform operations user1|local|AddDevice (s0 to s1).
3. Perform operation user1|local|SharePlug (s1 to s3).
4. From attacker knowledge set remark, user2 can replay user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare, which allows user2 to reaccept the device sharing invitation improperly (leading execution to s7 instead of a consistent semantic state).

** Explanation **:
The vulnerability triggers when there's an inconsistency in handling the transition state after user2's control is revoked (unshare). This potentially allows user2 to accept the share improperly based on the attacker¡¯s replay approach. The primary concern is that this allows unauthorized access without correct re-invitation, resulting in potential unauthorized control leading to security risks due to flawed permission handling or rollback.

# Summary
The provided state machines indicate a high-risk inconsistency that could allow an attacker to improperly regain permissions after being unshared, thus resulting in unintended control and security anomalies. Ensuring proper state handling and validation against the attacker's replay actions is crucial to mitigating such threats.
