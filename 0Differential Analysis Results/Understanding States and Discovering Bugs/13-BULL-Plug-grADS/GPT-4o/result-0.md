# State Semantic mapping table

State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state, no devices added, user1 and user2 have no actions available
1 | User1 has added a device and has control over it, user2 has no actions
2 | No devices added or shared, user1 and user2 have no actions available
3 | User1 has shared the device, waiting for user2 to accept the share, user2 can accept the share
4 | User1's device is shared, user2 has accepted the device share, both user1 and user2 can control the device
5 | User1 has unshared the device, user2's control is revoked, knowledge set updated
6 | Device is removed, resetting to a state with no devices, knowledge set is not updated
7 | User1 has shared the device again, user2 can attempt to accept the share once more

** Critical Vulnerability report **

## Vulnerability 1: Incorrect Knowledge Set Update

** Threat Level ** : High Risk

** Attack Path ** :
1. In state s4, user1 revokes the share using UnsharePlug which transitions to s5.
2. Attackers accumulate knowledge through the AcceptDeviceShare method in state s3.
3. Replay the AcceptDeviceShare action in state s7, thereby potentially re-obtaining control over the device.
4. Bypass the check after knowledge set is updated incorrectly, thus retaining unauthorized access.

** Repeat steps **:
- Starting from state s0, perform AddDevice to reach state s1.
- Next, perform SharePlug to reach state s3.
- Have user2 accept the share, transitioning the system to state s4.
- user1 then performs UnsharePlug leading the system to s5.
- Replay AcceptDeviceShare by user2 in state s7 to re-obtain control, causing unauthorized retention of user1's device information and control.

## Vulnerability 2: Inconsistent Device Control States

** Threat Level ** : Medium Risk

** Attack Path ** :
1. In state s4, user2 incorrectly succeeds in DeviceControl.
2. user1's control changes but attackers update certain properties, creating device control inconsistencies.
3. Device can be manipulated while revoking share does not consistently reset the device to a neutral state.

** Repeat steps **:
- Starting from state s0, AddDevice action to reach s1.
- SharePlug transitions to s3.
- Accepting by user2 moves to s4.
- user2 successfully attempts DeviceControl causing inconsistent device states not immediately evident to user1.

## Vulnerability 3: Information Leakage after Revoking Access

** Threat Level ** : High Risk

** Attack Path ** :
1. user1 shares device, transitioning to s3.
2. user2 accepts moving to s4.
3. user1 unshares the device causing the transition to s5.
4. user2 replays AcceptDeviceShare obtaining knowledge that user1 re-shared device or obtained no 'access denied' message, leading to leakage.

** Repeat steps **:
- Starting from state s0, AddDevice to s1.
- SharePlug to s3.
- user2's acceptance screens into s4.
- user1 unshares device to s5.
- user2 replays & receives device information confirming incomplete access denial and possible info.

Everything is Ok with the logic of the basemodel itself. The critical aspects to fix and review reside strongly in knowledge synchronization, attacker capability refinement, and permissions boundary details.
