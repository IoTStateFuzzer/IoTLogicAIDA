# State Semantic mapping table
State | semantic description
-----|---------
0 | Initial state. user1 has no device added yet. user2 cannot interact.
1 | user1 has added a device. user1 can share, unshare, remove, and control the device. user2 cannot interact.
2 | Dead-end state, characterized by "NoElement." No operations can proceed for both user1 and user2.
3 | user1 has shared the device with user2. user1 can still share, unshare, remove, and control the device. user2 is invited but hasn't accepted yet.
4 | user2 has accepted the device share. Both user1 and user2 can control the device. user1 can cancel or unshare, reverting user2's acceptance.
5 | user1 has revoked user2's share but retains the device. user1 can continue device operations or reshare.
6 | user1 has removed the device. Both user1 and user2 have no device interactions available.
7 | State similar to state 4. user2 repeatedly attempts to accept share invitation.

# Critical Vulnerability report
## Vulnerability 1: Information Leakage / Unintended Device Control by Attacker
**Threat Level**: High Risk

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker (user2) gains control capability through `user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare` by the knowledge set KS.
2. Replay the `user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare` action in states where `KS` includes this action.
3. Accepting device control multiple times in distinct states s3, s4, s7 enables user2 to control or attempt actions against expected flow.

**Repeat steps**:
Starting from state s0, perform the following:
1. user1 performs `user1|local|AddDevice` to reach state s1.
2. user1 performs `user1|local|SharePlug` to reach state s3.
3. user2 performs `user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare` to reach state s4.
4. user1 performs `user1|local|UnsharePlug` to reach state s5.
5. user1 performs `user1|local|SharePlug` again reaching state s7.
6. user2 replays `user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare` action.

Attack through knowledge set repetition and unvalidated permissions allow user2 unexpected device control.

Explanation:
1. In baseline states, user1 starts with sole device control.
2. Sharing with user2 briefly places control temporarily shared but confirmed.
3. Removal/unshare results in expected permissions ripple, but statefuzzing maintains attacker control through reuse of past actions.
4. This unforeseen control grants potential privacy and integrity violations. Successful state transition through unexpected flows indicates fault in input validation handling repetitive acceptances or share recalls by user2.

Overall, the discovered anomaly where the attacker retains control or information post-revocation needs validating ownership checks within the system logic to prevent unintended engagements or leakage after such transitions.
