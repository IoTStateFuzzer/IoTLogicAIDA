Reason: The majority of the responses indicated that the sharing attempts by user1 were unsuccessful due to the device already being shared with user2, resulting in a 'REPETITION_SHARE' error. Although there were successful device configuration and third-party information retrieval actions, these were unrelated to the sharing task. The main issue was the duplicate share attempt error code preventing the operation from proceeding."

Most of the responses confirmed that the sharing attempt was validated with a 'success': true status. The operation managed to add the device account to user2 effectively, as indicated by the absence of any 'REPETITION_SHARE' error in this successful attempt."
