The consistent pattern of tcp and mqtt packets, as well as the presence of consistent payloads without errors, corroborates the successful transmission and execution of the device control command. Although one report mentioned the absence of a proper response, the majority of evidence supports success."

The presence of consistent payloads without errors or failure indicators, across both packet types, strongly suggests that the device control command was successfully executed. Despite one report citing no definitive success, the cumulative indicators affirm a successful operation."
