        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The operation to unshare the plug was consistently indicated as successful across multiple traffic analyses. The key packet at endpoint '/api.json/smartlife/m/sharing/device/remove' returned 'true' with a 'success' status, confirming the successful unsharing action. Additional packets supported successful responses related to resources and member configurations, further reinforcing the effective removal of device sharing. Irrelevant traffic about app configurations and third-party activities was correctly excluded from influencing the operation."
