Despite some evidence of command sending via MQTT, the presence of repeated '0x00000040' responses, lack of payload, and absence of acknowledgment suggest issues with the device's response, possibly due to lack of authorization or network issues, therefore indicating a failure in remote device control execution by user2."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: The repeated appearance of '0x00000040' packets and 'Abs_Len1' with no substantive response from the device suggest unsuccessful device control attempts by user2. Although one analysis interprets the short packet as an acknowledgment, the dominant pattern implies that no successful action was taken, likely due to permission issues or ineffective communication."
