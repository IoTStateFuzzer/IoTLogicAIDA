        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Analysis of network traffic packets consistently indicate a successful completion of the plug unsharing operation. In particular, packets sent to 'smartlife/m/sharing/device/remove' consistently show payloads with 'success': true and 'result': true, corroborated by status 'ok'. These responses affirm the unsharing of the plug with user1 and confirm successful execution. Additional packets that mention configuration updates and permit resources confirm the unsharing operation's outcome, despite being tangential to the core operation."
