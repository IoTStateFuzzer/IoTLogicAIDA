        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: The consensus among the reported reasons is that the operation to share a device repeatedly with the same user (user2) failed because the system detected it as an action on an already shared device. The descriptions consistently point to the operation not proceeding due to the device already being in a shared status with the specified user. Despite varying details, the core reason for failure is unanimously identified as the redundancy of the share operation, as evidenced by specific traffic and error messages such as 'This device has already been shared with the user' and error codes like 'REPETITION_SHARE'. This indicates a thorough checking mechanism within the system to prevent duplicate sharing actions."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The operation's success is underscored by affirmative responses from the server, detailed as success statuses in the traffic analysis and explicit acknowledgments that the device share was processed. The reasons provided paint a clear picture of a system acknowledging the sharing operation, with specific mentions of successful fields, absence of error messages, and provision of relational IDs which underpin the operation's acceptance. This aligns with a successful action of user1 sharing control with user2, marked by server-side confirmations and the completion status being communicated back to the initiating parties."
