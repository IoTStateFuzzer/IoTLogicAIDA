Reason: The majority of analyses indicate successful MQTT and TCP communication between user2 and the IoT device, as shown by the presence of device control-related traffic topics, absence of error codes, and the relay of control commands via appropriate protocol messages. Despite one report highlighting a potential lack of successful command execution based on the observation of payloads and an absence of acknowledgment packets, the consensus leans towards successful operation due to the identification of relevant headers, the topics of MQTT packets that are directly related to device control, and the presence of TCP acknowledgments in other analyses."
