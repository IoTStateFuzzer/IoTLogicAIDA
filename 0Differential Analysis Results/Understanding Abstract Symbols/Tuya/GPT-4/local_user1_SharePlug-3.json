        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: All available data points to the fact that the attempted operation to share the plug with user2 failed because this device had already been shared to user2. This conclusion is evident from consistent error codes and messages across different reports. More specifically, the 'REPETITION_SHARE' error code and associated messages indicate that sharing cannot be performed because the device has already been shared with this user. Minor pieces of information regarding general devices and services are, although present in the data, not directly related to the sharing operation at hand."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: After the initial failed attempt, it appears that a subsequent attempt to share the plug with user2 was successful. Providing reinforcement to this conclusion we have several favorable factors. For instance, specific mentions of 'user2' as the receiver, changes in the device sharing status, and successful status 'true' in the response from the service. Scrutinizing the available information underscores further success factors such as relationId suggesting correct operation execution and traffic packet information wherein user2 is part of the member list. Notwithstanding irrelevant pieces of information regarding services and device configuration, the indispensable data sets provide adequate proof of a successful operation."
