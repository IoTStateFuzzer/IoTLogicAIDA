This is manifested in the 'REPETITION_SHARE' error code that appears in the response payload of the /api.json/smartlife/m/sharing/device/account/add URL traffic packet, which substantializes a success value of 'false' and an explanatory message displaying that the device has already been shared with the user."

Reason: The device sharing operation with user2 has successfully concluded, which is deduced from the response payload of the traffic packet with URL /api.json/smartlife/m/sharing/device/account/add. The payload reveals a success value of 'true', a status of 'ok', and includes receiverName as user2. The manifestation of a subsequent successful sharing operation insinuates that either a different context was utilised for the operation, or the operation was retried."
