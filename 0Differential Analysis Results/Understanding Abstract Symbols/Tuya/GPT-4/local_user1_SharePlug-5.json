        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: An analysis of the operations indicates that the attempt to share the device with user2 failed. This failure can be primarily attributed to the fact that the device had previously been shared with the same user (user2). Such an action of repeated sharing is not permitted in this context, precipitating the unsuccessful operation. This conclusion is strongly corroborated by repetitive signals of operation failure and the recurring information indicating that the device had already been in a shared state with user2."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The data strongly indicate a successful device sharing operation with user2. Support for this assertion is found in repeated signals of operation success, with an explicit 'success': 'true' field in the traffic, and the identification of 'user2' as the device receiver. More specifically, the circumstances under which this success appears to have occurred indicates that a previously failed operation was overcome, a different operation scope was executed, or a combination of the two happened. This leads to the conclusion that the device sharing permissions were effectively granted to user2, as suggested by the successful status visible in the device account addition details."
