        "Operation result: Success. Reason: A critical POST request to '/api.json/smartlife/m/sharing/device/remove' returned {'result':true, 'success':true, 'status':'ok'}, which programmatically confirms the unshare operation's success. Subsequent verification via '/sharing/resource/member/relation/page' showing revoked permissions and the absence of contradictory error codes in other API interactions (which pertain to routine configuration checks for third-party integrations and device settings) further corroborates the outcome. The operational success is determined by the explicit success indicators in the core unsharing API response, while ancillary traffic does not alter this conclusion."
