The subsequent 0x00000040 packet (PUBCOMP/DISCONNECT) indicates proper session completion through retained message flushing and protocol-compliant termination after successful remote control execution."

Reason: The repeated 0x00000040 MQTT packets predominantly indicate retained message clearance and session finalization following successful operations, though one minority analysis suggests potential connection failure. Majority consensus confirms this represents normal QoS completion (PUBCOMP) or non-error disconnect after prior successful command delivery, as the packet sequence aligns with MQTT's stateful communication flow."
