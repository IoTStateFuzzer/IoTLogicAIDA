Reason: The device sharing operation failed due to the REPETITION_SHARE error code in the /sharing/device/account/add API response, which explicitly confirms the device has already been shared with user2. This error code consistently appears across all evaluations, indicating a pre-existing sharing relationship that prevents duplication."

Reason: The /sharing/device/account/add API response confirms success:true with receiverName=\"user2\" and a generated relationId (e.g., 117443320), validating that the local sharing operation was executed successfully. All evaluations concur that the payload explicitly demonstrates completion of the sharing process without errors."
