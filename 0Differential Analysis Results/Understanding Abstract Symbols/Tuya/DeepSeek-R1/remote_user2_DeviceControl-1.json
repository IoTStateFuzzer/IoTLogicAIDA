Reason: Consensus analysis confirms MQTT protocol compliance through PUBLISH (0x30) and PUBACK (0x32/0x40) packet exchange on device-specific topic smart/mb/in/208580022462ab36ab23. The payload version 2.2 alignment, QoS acknowledgment mechanics, and absence of error codes demonstrate successful command delivery. While some reports mention ancillary packets (CONNECT/SUBSCRIBE/PINGRESP), all agree these support rather than contradict core transaction success."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Majority analysis identifies standalone 0x40 packets as valid QoS 1 PUBACK confirmations rather than incomplete QoS 2 sequences. Four reports correctly interpret these as secondary acknowledgments reinforcing prior successful transactions, while the single 'Failed' assessment appears to misclassify PUBACK as PUBREC. Protocol consistency across multiple successful transmissions outweighs isolated misinterpretation."
