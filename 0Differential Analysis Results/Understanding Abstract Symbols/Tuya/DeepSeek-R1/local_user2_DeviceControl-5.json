Reason: Majority analysis (3/5) indicates insufficient confirmation - only isolated TCP packets (status 135/'w3.3') were observed without required MQTT control channel confirmation or proper device acknowledgment. Protocol mismatch concerns (repeated 'U' fields) and lack of bidirectional validation suggest uncompleted control attempts despite command transmission."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Unanimous consensus (5/5) confirms valid control through coordinated MQTT-TCP patterns. Persistent MQTT publishes to device-specific topics (smart/mb/in/...) with versioned payloads (2.2) were systematically followed by TCP responses containing status codes (123/28/135) and acknowledgment markers ('k','U','3.3'), demonstrating temporary local permission activation and complete command execution cycle."
