Reason: Multiple MQTT PUBLISH packets (0x30, 0x32) with QoS 1 were sent to device control topic 'smart/mb/in/208580022462ab36ab23', followed by protocol-compliant PUBACK (0x40) confirmations from the broker. The sequential packet flow - command dispatch, QoS 1 acknowledgment, and absence of error packets - confirms successful remote execution through the cloud infrastructure."

Repeated confirmations align with MQTT protocol requirements for reliable message delivery, demonstrating complete broker-side processing and operational continuity in the remote control channel."
