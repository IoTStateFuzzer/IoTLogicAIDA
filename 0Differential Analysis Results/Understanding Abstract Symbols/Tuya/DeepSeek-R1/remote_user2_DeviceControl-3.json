        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis confirms successful device control through MQTT QoS 2 protocol flow. Four of five evaluations agree the sequence of PUBLISH (0x30), PUBREL (0x32), and PUBACK (0x40) packets demonstrates valid command delivery and acknowledgment. The single failure rationale about PUBREC anomalies represents a minority interpretation inconsistent with the QoS 2 handshake completion evidenced by session termination via DISCONNECT."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Majority interpretation (3/5) concludes normal operation despite isolated DISCONNECT/PUBREC packets. Evaluators contextualize the 0x40 packet as either secondary session closure after prior confirmed operations or redundant signaling. Minority failure interpretations about missing PUBLISH traffic are outweighed by the prevailing view that this represents post-command session management."
