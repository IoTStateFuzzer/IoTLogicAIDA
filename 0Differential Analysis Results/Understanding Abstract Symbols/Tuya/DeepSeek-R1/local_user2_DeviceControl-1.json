        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consolidated analysis shows MQTT commands (payloads 2.2/3.3) were successfully delivered through the 'smart/mb/in/...' channel with corresponding TCP-layer confirmations. Device_0 responses included status codes 'w3.3/k' and 'U' flags, demonstrating command execution verification. The single failure indication regarding authorization appears contextually unrelated to the operational success metrics captured in network traffic patterns."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Multi-protocol evidence confirms persistent command execution - MQTT control packets (including 2.2 payload variants) were acknowledged through TCP-layer responses (k...3.3 patterns) and empty MQTT ACK packets indicating QoS-level delivery confirmation. Error indications in one report likely represent transient artifacts rather than systemic failure, as subsequent packets maintained operational continuity."
