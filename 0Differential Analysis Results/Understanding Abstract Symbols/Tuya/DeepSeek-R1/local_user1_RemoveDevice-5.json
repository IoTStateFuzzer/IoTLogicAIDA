        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The operation succeeded through coordinated MQTT and HTTP confirmation. An MQTT 'del' command explicitly removed device 208580022462ab36ab23 from the local network, while the HTTP /device/reset endpoint returned verified 'result':true and 'success':true responses. Critical identifiers (devId/gwId) remained consistent across protocols, and the 'isShare':false parameter confirms legitimate owner-initiated removal. Third-party service interactions did not affect core deletion verification."
