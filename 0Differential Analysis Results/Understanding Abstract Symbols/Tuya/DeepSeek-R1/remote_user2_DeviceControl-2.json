Reason: Consensus analysis shows MQTT PUBACK (0x30/0x40) and PUBREC (0x32) packets consistently confirm successful QoS 2 delivery through 'smart/mb/in/208580022462ab36ab23' topic. Multiple acknowledgments from broker and matching command payloads in PUBLISH packets demonstrate complete transaction flow per MQTT protocol specifications."

The lone failure rationale (incomplete QoS 2 transaction) is statistically outweighed by redundant confirmation patterns and absence of error codes in traffic captures."
