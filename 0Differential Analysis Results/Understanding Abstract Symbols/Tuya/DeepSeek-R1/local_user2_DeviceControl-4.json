TCP responses from device_0 containing 'w3.3' (parameter write confirmation) and 'k' (acknowledgment markers) validate command execution.

Reason: Repeated MQTT commands (payload '2.2...') to the device control topic were followed by matching TCP acknowledgments ('k3.3' from user2 and 'w3.3' from device_0). Persistent control signals and parameter patterns (3.3) in bidirectional traffic confirm valid temporary access through the local channel, with no authentication failures or persistent error markers observed in the transaction."
