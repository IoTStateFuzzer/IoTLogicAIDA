        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic analysis confirms a successful device unsharing operation through a POST request to '/api.json/smartlife/m/sharing/device/remove' with explicit success indicators ('result':true, 'success':true). This core action is further validated by subsequent checks to '/sharing/resource/member/relation/page', which show user2's access status as 'false', demonstrating effective revocation of sharing privileges. The consistency across multiple traffic observations confirms both the execution and verification of the unsharing process."
