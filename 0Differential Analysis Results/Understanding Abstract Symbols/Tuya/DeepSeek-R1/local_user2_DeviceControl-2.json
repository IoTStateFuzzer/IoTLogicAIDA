TCP responses containing status codes (3.3) and protocol-specific markers (kAbs_Len4) confirm device acknowledgment. While isolated TCP packets showed error indicators, the majority of traffic validates successful command execution through the MQTT pub/sub mechanism, likely leveraging temporary permissions granted to user2's local channel."

Reason: Repeated MQTT PUBLISH operations to the device-specific command topic (smart/mb/in/208580022462ab36ab23) with structured payloads (2.2Abs_Len...) triggered TCP responses containing validated control parameters (kAbs_Len4|3.3). The clustered acknowledgments and sequential payload alignment indicate protocol-compliant execution, overriding sporadic error codes through the exploitation of temporary access privileges despite user2's unauthorized role."
