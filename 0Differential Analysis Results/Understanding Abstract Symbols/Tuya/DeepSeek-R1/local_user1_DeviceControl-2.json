        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The MQTT protocol sequence demonstrates successful device control through PUBLISH (0x30), PUBACK (0x32), PUBREC (0x40), and PUBCOMP packets on topic 'smart/mb/in/208580022462ab36ab23'. This multi-stage QoS 1/2 handshake confirms command delivery was acknowledged by both broker and device. The PUBACK validates message receipt, while PUBREC and PUBCOMP complete the QoS 2 reliability flow, ensuring end-to-end confirmation of the IoT device's command execution."
