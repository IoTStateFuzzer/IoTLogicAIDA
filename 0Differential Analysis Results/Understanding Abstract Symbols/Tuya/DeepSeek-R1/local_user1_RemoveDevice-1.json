        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The operation succeeded due to consistent MQTT confirmation of device deletion ('type':'del' targeting devId/gwId) combined with successful HTTP responses from the /device/reset endpoint ('result':true and 'success':true). Ownership validation via 'isShare':false and proper device identification further corroborate the success. While unrelated configuration checks for third-party services exist in the traffic, they do not impact the core deletion process, which was fully executed via local network commands."
