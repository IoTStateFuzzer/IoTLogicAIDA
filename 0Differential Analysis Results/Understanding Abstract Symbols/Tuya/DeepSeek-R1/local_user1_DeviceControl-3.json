        "Operation result: Success. Reason: MQTT PUBLISH (0x30) and PUBACK (0x32/0x40) packets confirm successful command delivery via topic 'smart/mb/in/208580022462ab36ab23' using QoS 1. The PUBACK sequence demonstrates protocol-compliant acknowledgment, with 0x32 confirming command execution and 0x40 indicating retained message confirmation and clean session termination. The structured payload (version 2.2) and complete QoS 1 flow (PUBLISH\u2192PUBACK\u2192DISCONNECT) validate end-to-end processing by the IoT infrastructure."
