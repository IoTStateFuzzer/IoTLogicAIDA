        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis confirms device removal success through multiple corroborating technical indicators: (1) MQTT payloads consistently show a 'del' type command targeting device ID 208580022462ab36ab23 with 'isShare':false, confirming direct ownership termination rather than shared access revocation. (2) Synchronous HTTP verification via the /device/reset endpoint returned {'result':true, 'success':true}, validating server-side completion. (3) Network traffic patterns demonstrate successful command execution sequence - first API confirmation, then local MQTT unregistration. While other configuration checks exist in the traffic logs (third-party integrations, linkage rules), these represent routine background processes and do not conflict with the core removal mechanism's success."
