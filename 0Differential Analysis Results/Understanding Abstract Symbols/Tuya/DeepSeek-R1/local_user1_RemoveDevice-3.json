        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The operation is confirmed successful by the MQTT message (type 'del') explicitly deleting device ID 208580022462ab36ab23, supported by the '/device/reset' API returning result/success:true. The 'isShare':false field confirms direct ownership termination rather than shared device revocation. Other API activities (third-party integrations, configuration checks) are ancillary and do not impact the core deletion event. The MQTT protocol validation (packet ID 0x00000032) and devId consistency across systems provide technical corroboration."
