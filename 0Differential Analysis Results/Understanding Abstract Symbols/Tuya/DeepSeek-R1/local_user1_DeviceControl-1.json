        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Analysis of MQTT protocol sequence shows a complete QoS 1 acknowledgment flow: 1) User1 sent a control command via PUBLISH packet (0x30) to device-specific topic smart/mb/in/208580022462ab36ab23; 2) MQTT broker responded with PUBACK (0x32/0x40) confirming successful reception; 3) The transaction concluded with PUBCOMP (0x40) indicating QoS handshake completion and a final DISCONNECT packet demonstrating proper session termination. Multiple packet types across different control flow stages (PUBLISH-PUBACK-PUBCOMP-DISCONNECT) collectively confirm successful command delivery and processing through local MQTT infrastructure."
