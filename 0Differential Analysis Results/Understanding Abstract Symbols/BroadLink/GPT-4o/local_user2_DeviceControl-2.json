Reason: The presence of multiple successful response packets (identified by 'DNA.TransmissionControl' namespace and payload with indiciator=1, suggesting control acknowledgment) suggests that the device control operation was executed successfully. Despite the unrelated UI upgrade packets, the core device control responses indicate the device acknowledged the commands."

Reason: Even though some packets are unrelated to the device control operation, such as those containing random data strings, the established UDP communication pattern (device_0 to user2_local) and the nature of device responses imply that the device control operation was successful."
