The payload responses have the same endpointId, and the payloads contain successful action indicators, including 'pwri':0 and 'indicator':1, which suggest the command execution was successful and the device is operational. The status '0' in these responses commonly indicates a successful operation in most protocols."

The UDP packets detected likely pertain to device discovery or keep-alive mechanisms rather than indicating successful control attempts. User2 did not achieve a valid control operation in this packet set."
