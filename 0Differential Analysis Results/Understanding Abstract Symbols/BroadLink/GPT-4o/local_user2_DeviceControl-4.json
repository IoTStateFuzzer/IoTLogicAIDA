        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: The traffic includes attempts by user2 to control the device locally, as indicated by the /device/control/v2/sdkcontrol header. However, the payload data appears to contain default or unsuccessful control parameters, particularly as the 'notpadding' value as well as other key indicators like 'indicato' and 'maxworktime' do not suggest successful device operation. Additionally, the presence of multiple, consistent control attempts in quick succession typically signifies failed attempts in controlling an IoT device. Furthermore, some UDP traffic from device_0 and user2_local may be unrelated to the actual control action, contributing noise rather than signaling success."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: The second traffic data also indicates that user2 tried to control the device, supported by consistent UDP traffic which is likely noise or unrelated heartbeat signals rather than successful control operations. This suggests that user2 does not have the necessary permissions or the device control process is being blocked or unfulfilled. The lack of varied successful control outcomes across the attempt data corroborates the continuous failure in exerting control."
