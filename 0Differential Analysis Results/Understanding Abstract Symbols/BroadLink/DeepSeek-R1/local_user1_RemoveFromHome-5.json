        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The /appsync/group/member/delfamilymember API explicitly returned {'error':0,'msg':'ok'}, confirming successful removal. While user2's type=1 persists in the subsequent /getfamilymember response, this aligns with their transition from owner-tier (type=0) to non-owner status (type=1), not retention as a regular member. The majority of analyses interpret type=1 as evidence of successful downgrading rather than failed removal. A minority perspective about incomplete synchronization or caching is less likely, as administrative APIs typically reflect real-time status."
