        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic analysis shows UDP packets targeting 'device_0' and 'user1_local' with payloads containing structured command sequences (e.g., 'CAbs_Len' codes and 'U' indicators). These patterns align with control protocol requirements, and the local channel context ensures direct device communication. The absence of error flags, authentication failures, or packet retransmissions \u2013 combined with the presence of acknowledgment-like codes (e.g., 'CAbs_Len89|') \u2013 confirms successful command execution. Furthermore, the user1_local endpoint identification validates legitimate user authorization for this local control action."
