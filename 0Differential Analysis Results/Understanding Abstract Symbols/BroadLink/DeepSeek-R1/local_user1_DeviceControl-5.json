        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic analysis confirms successful transmission of device control commands through UDP packets between 'device_0' (port 80) and 'user1_local' (port 144). Payload patterns such as 'CAbs_Len' with parameter placeholders, alignment with local IoT device protocols, and the absence of error responses or retransmissions collectively validate effective command delivery. The consistency across observations\u2014specific addressing, control-related payload structures, and protocol adherence\u2014demonstrates reliable execution of the control operation without operational anomalies."
