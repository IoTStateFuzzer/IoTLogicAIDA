        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The `/appsync/group/member/invited/joinfamily` endpoint returned `error:0` and `status:0`, confirming successful acceptance of the invitation to family ID `11b9af345feef8afb71de0053611d0eb` (user1's family). Subsequent device control errors (status -7) reflect temporary device rebinding requirements post-acceptance but are unrelated to the core membership operation, which was validated by the API's explicit success confirmation and consistent status codes across observations."
