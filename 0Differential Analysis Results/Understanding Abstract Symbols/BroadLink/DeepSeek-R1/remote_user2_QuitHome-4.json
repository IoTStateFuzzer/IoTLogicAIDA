This confirms the core family group exit operation completed successfully. Subsequent NETWORK_TIME_OUT errors in device control interfaces represent separate connectivity issues unrelated to the account removal process, as the family group dissociation had already been finalized at the API level."

The DEVICE_RESET errors (-7) observed in downstream device control operations demonstrate expected system behavior after account dissociation, as the removed user naturally loses device access privileges. These secondary errors validate rather than contradict the operation's success."

This error state suggests either 1) Invalid temporary authentication tokens after previous successful quit operations, 2) Attempted duplicate exit from an already vacated family group, or 3) Server-side permission revocation prior to operation completion. Garbled error messages further imply corrupted authentication parameters in subsequent requests."
