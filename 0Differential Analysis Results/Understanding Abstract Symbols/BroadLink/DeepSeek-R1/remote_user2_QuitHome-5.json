Reason: Consensus across both getfamilymember and quitfamily endpoints shows persistent status code -30107 with undecipherable error messages, strongly indicating authorization failure. This likely reflects invalid permissions (either through prior account removal from the family group or session invalidation), making the quit-home operation fundamentally inexecutable for user2's current access state."
