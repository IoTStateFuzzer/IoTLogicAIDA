Reason: Unified evidence shows the invitation workflow completed fully: user2 (type 1) appears in the family list alongside user1 (type 0), all operations return status/error 0, and QR code regeneration succeeds. This confirms the system processed the invitation acceptance, updated membership states correctly, and maintained functional integrity post-operation."
