Reason: Cloud service confirmation through HTTP POST responses (status=0, msg=\"ok\") from ai-service-chn-001.ibroadlink.com and app-service-chn-467a8f05.ibroadlink.com validates successful device template retrieval (Smart Plug models) and family/group synchronization. Local network confirmation is evidenced by UDP traffic between user1 and device_0, showing active discovery/authentication packets typical of device initialization. The combined cloud success codes and local communication patterns, with no error indicators in payloads, demonstrate complete AddDevice operation execution."
