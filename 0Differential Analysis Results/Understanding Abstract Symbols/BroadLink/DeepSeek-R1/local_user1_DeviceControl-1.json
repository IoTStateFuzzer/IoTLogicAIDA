        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Multiple consistent indicators confirm successful command execution - UDP packets targeting device_0 and user1_local contain structured control payloads (e.g., 'ZAbs_Len2', 'UAbs_Len28') matching IoT protocols. The bidirectional communication (port 80 for commands, port 144 for responses) demonstrates proper local channel operation. Critical confirmation comes from both the absence of error codes/retransmissions and the presence of response packets with control acknowledgment patterns like 'CAbs_Len5' and 'CAbs_Len89', which validate successful command delivery and device execution in the local network environment."
