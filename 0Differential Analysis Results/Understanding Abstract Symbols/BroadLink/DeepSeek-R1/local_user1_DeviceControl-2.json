        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consolidated analysis confirms UDP control patterns through multiple technical indicators: 1) Targeted communication between user1_local (port 144) and device_0 (port 80) aligns with IoT control standards, 2) Payload structures containing sequential command patterns (CAbs_Len5, CAbs_Len89, UZAbs_Len) demonstrate parameterized control instructions, 3) Established device ownership context eliminates authorization concerns, 4) Absence of error codes, retransmission attempts, or security challenge patterns in packet sequences validates uninterrupted command execution. The combination of protocol-compliant port usage, structured command syntax, and operational continuity provides definitive evidence of successful local device control."
