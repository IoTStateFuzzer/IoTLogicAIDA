        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consolidated analysis of cloud and local network activity confirms success. HTTP POST responses from ai-service-chn-001.ibroadlink.com and app-service-chn endpoints consistently returned status code 0 ('ok'), verifying successful cloud-side operations including retrieval of Smart Plug configuration data (product models RM2300/RM2500, AP/WiFi setup methods) and family group synchronization (user1home). Complementary UDP packets (144/176/64/96 byte payloads) between device_0 and user1_local demonstrate a complete local network handshake sequence during provisioning, confirming successful device discovery, secure local communication establishment, and final integration with cloud management systems. The coordinated cloud validation and multi-stage local network protocol execution collectively validate the end-to-end success of the device provisioning workflow."
