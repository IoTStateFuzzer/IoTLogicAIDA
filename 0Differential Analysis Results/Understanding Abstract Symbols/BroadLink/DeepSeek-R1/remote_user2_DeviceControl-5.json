Reason: Consensus analysis confirms successful execution through multiple congruent evidences - HTTP POST responses with 'Response' namespace, control payloads containing 'pwr' state changes (0/1), and cloud service acceptance patterns.

This triad of evidence (error classification, numerical status code, and operational message) conclusively shows revoked access privileges due to device reset procedures, rendering user2's temporary authorization credentials invalid post-reset event."
