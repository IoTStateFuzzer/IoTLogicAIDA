Reason: Consensus analysis confirms success through multiple consistent indicators: 1) HTTP POST responses from Broadlink cloud services (ai-service-chn-001 and app-service-chn-467a8f05 domains) consistently show status=0 and msg='ok', validating successful cloud-side device registration and family group synchronization. 2) Local UDP traffic patterns between user1 and device_0 demonstrate successful local network handshaking, essential for device provisioning. 3) Payload analysis confirms receipt of device configuration data across multiple smart plug models, with cloud responses confirming proper data acceptance. The combination of cloud service acknowledgments and local network communication establishes end-to-end success in device addition operations."
