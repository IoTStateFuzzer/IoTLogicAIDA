        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Repeated HTTP control commands via /device/control/v2/sdkconfirm maintained status 0, with UDP traffic reflecting persistent local device communication post-control. The majority analyses highlight sustained state updates (e.g., power toggling) and alignment of UDP patterns with successful control. The 'Failed' analysis overlooks cumulative state changes and misattributes UDP repetition to failure rather than confirmation."
