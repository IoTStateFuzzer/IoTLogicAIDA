        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic demonstrates successful local device control through UDP packets directed to 'device_0' (port 80) and 'user1_local' (port 144), exhibiting bidirectional communication patterns. Payload structures containing encoded command markers ('CAbs_Len', 'UZ') and length parameters confirm valid control instructions. The absence of error codes, retransmission attempts, or permission-denied signatures further supports successful execution within an authorized local network context."
