"[[  \n    \"Operation result: Success. Reason: The /appsync/group/dev/manage response shows error:0 and msg:\"ok\", confirming successful device removal. Other traffic includes normal family data queries and firmware update failures (status:-74978) likely unrelated to the removal operation.\",  \n    \"Operation result: Success. Reason: Repeated dev/manage endpoint success (status:0) indicates proper device deletion. UDP packets suggest local device communication during removal process.\",  \n    \"Operation result: Success. Reason: Consistent dev/manage success response with error:0. Time-synchronization traffic in /device/control/v2/sdkcontrol shows normal post-removal device state updates.\",  \n    \"Operation result: Success. Reason: Core dev/manage API confirms removal success. Irrelevant firmware errors persist but don't affect operation outcome.\",  \n    \"Operation result: Success. Reason: Multiple successful dev/manage responses and encoded control payloads (paVaWqHSAws1...) suggest proper device removal execution.\",  \n    \"Operation result: Success. Reason: Device management API consistently reports OK status. Additional control channel responses with status:0 reinforce successful operation.\",  \n    \"Operation result: Success. Reason: Final dev/manage confirmation with error:0, accompanied by device control channel closure patterns in UDP traffic.\",  \n    \"Operation result: Success. Reason: Persistent dev/manage success across all traffic sets confirms removal completion despite background firmware errors.\"  \n]]"
