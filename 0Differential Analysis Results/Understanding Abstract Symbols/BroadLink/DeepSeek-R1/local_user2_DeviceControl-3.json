Reason: Consensus analysis confirms success through HTTP POST responses (status code 0) containing control execution evidence like 'pwr' state changes and encoded command payloads. Local UDP traffic patterns between device_0 and user2_local demonstrate operational confirmation, aligning with cloud-mediated command workflows where cloud authorization precedes local execution."

Reason: Persistent UDP communication patterns between device_0 and user2_local \u2013 observed across multiple analysis cycles \u2013 validate sustained local connectivity after initial cloud control. While payloads lack explicit success markers, the absence of error codes and consistency with post-authorization device behavior patterns functionally confirm operation success."
