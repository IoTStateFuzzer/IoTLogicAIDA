        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis confirms the '/group/member/invited/joinfamily' API returned status 0 with target familyid '11b9af345feef8afb71de0053611d0eb' (user1home), irrefutably validating successful invitation acceptance by user2. While subsequent DEVICE_RESET/-7 errors indicate device rebinding requirements for newly joined members, these post-acceptance control limitations exist orthogonal to the invitation process itself. The core success metric derives from the API's explicit confirmation of group membership alteration, with error codes in unrelated device management flows being expected post-join behavior rather than indicators of invitation failure."
