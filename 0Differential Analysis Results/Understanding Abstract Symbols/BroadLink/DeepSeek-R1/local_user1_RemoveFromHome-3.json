        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The majority analysis (4/5) confirms the deletion API '/appsync/group/member/delfamilymember' returned error code 0 and 'msg':'ok', the definitive success indicator. While user2 persists in '/getfamilymember' responses with type=1, this status change from owner (type=0) to non-owner/removed reflects successful permission revocation rather than incomplete deletion. The persistent listing likely represents historical metadata retention or delayed synchronization rather than active membership, as the critical deletion endpoint explicitly confirmed the operation's success."
