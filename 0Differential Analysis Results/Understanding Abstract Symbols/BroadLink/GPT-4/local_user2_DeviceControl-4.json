        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Majority of the views from different perspectives indicate a successful operation. The successful control operations are asserted by the presence of data indicating successful device control in traffic, '/device/control/v2/sdkcontrol' endpoint responses found in the traffic, DNA Transmission Control Response events, and a change in the payload data from one control command to another. There is also the successful completion of an upgrade event indicated within the traffic packet. However, it's worth noting there's an isolated view suggesting the device status parameters remained the same in consecutive requests, which usually suggests a failed operation, but this does not align with majority opinions."

        "Operation result: Partial Failure. Reason: Consensus points toward there being at least partial failure in the operation. This is suggested by points such as repeated UDP traffic suggesting the device may not have accepted the operation command, and that some payload could not be accurately discerned due to encoding or masking, pointing toward indeterminacy or partial failure. However, some data does suggest aspects of the operation were successful, including successful device control activities indicated by UDP traffic related to device_0 and user2, and higher data length in 'user2_local' traffic. Nonetheless, the majority view leans toward operation failure."
