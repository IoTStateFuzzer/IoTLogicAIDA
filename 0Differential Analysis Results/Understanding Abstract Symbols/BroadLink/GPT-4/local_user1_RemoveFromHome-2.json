        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic analysis consistently indicates a successful execution of the operation where a user is removed from the home. The first packet retrieved valid user information with no errors, suggesting the system recognized both user1 and user2. A response message of 'ok', along with 'error' and 'status' codes at zero in the second packet confirms the successful initiation of the member removal operation. Thereafter, changes in the final state of family members signified by updated member lists and possibly their status, attests to the successful completion of the removal process. Consequently, it is deduced that user1 successfully removed user2 or other users from the home."
