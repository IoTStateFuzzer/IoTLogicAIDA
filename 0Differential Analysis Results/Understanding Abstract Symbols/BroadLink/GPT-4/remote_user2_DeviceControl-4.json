The response packets contain 'DNA.TransmissionControl' and 'Response' fields, indicating a control operation has taken a place, and a successful response was provided. Also, the 'data' fields in the packets contain variations indicating different state changes that were requested (i.e., power on/off), suggesting that the 'DeviceControl' operation was successful."

The presence of an 'ErrorResponse' in the traffic suggests an error occurred during the 'DeviceControl' action. The 'message' field states 'device reset, please rebind' and the 'status' field with value -7 also point towards a failure in the execution of the operation. Thus, the operation ended up in a failure."
