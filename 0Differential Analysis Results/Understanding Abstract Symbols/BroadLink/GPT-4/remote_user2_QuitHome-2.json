The status and error codes were reported as 0, and the network timeout in subsequent device control attempts further supports the conclusion that user2 was disconnected from the home network."

Reason: While the 'quitfamily' operation itself was successful, indicated by the successful status and error codes, subsequent device control issues, particularly the 'DEVICE_RESET' error, suggest operational challenges post-operation. This mixed result reflects a successful quit operation but with potential device stability issues."

Reason: All reports consistently indicate a failure in the 'quitfamily' operation with a status code of -30107, suggesting significant errors in the operation's execution. Additionally, device control issues and system errors, such as 'DEVICE_RESET', further confirm the operation's failure."
