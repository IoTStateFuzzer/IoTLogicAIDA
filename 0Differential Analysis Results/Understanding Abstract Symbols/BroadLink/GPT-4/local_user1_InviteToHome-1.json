All entries indicate that the error and status codes were '0', and the response messages were 'ok', confirming no errors occurred during the process. The generation of a QR code for the invitee, which is a critical step in the invitation process, was successfully completed in each case. This QR code generation is crucial as it facilitates the actual joining of the invitee to the home group. The detailed traffic analysis further supports that the invitation operations were executed without any issues, starting from user information retrieval to the final QR code generation."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The invitation process for the second user, User2, was also successful, as evidenced by the consistent traffic data across all entries. The process involved fetching and updating family member information to include User2, alongside User1, with appropriate user types indicating their roles within the home network. The generation of a QR code for User2 was error-free, as indicated by 'status' and 'error' codes both being '0'. This QR code is essential for User2's integration into the home network, allowing access or participation as a new member. The traffic data uniformly supports a successful invitation process, with no discrepancies or errors noted in the handling of the requests."
