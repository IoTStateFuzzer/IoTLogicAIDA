        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The operation to remove a family member was consistently reported as successful across all traffic analyses. The POST requests to '/appsync/group/member/delfamilymember' returned successful status and error codes, and subsequent checks with '/appsync/group/member/getfamilymember' confirmed the removal by showing an updated family member list without the removed user. The traffic data consistently supported the successful execution of the removal operation without any reported errors."
