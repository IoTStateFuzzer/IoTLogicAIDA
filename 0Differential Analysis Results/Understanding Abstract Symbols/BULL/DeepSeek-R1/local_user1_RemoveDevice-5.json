        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The HTTP DELETE request (200 status with \"success\":true payload) definitively confirms device removal. Subsequent verification mechanisms align cohesively - MQTT property updates show timer resets (Enable:0 states), GET requests return null/non-existent device data, and all post-deletion checks systematically confirm eradication of device information and associated schedules. This multi-protocol consistency (HTTP+REST + MQTT) provides layered validation of complete operational success."
