        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The HTTP DELETE request successfully removed the device (mHXk6DR3zDiKDwQd4vRo000000) with a 200 status code and explicit \"success\":true payload confirmation. Subsequent GET requests for device information and schedules represent standard post-deletion verification processes, while the MQTT properties update resetting PowerSwitch timers to default values demonstrates systematic configuration cleanup following device removal. These coordinated API and protocol interactions confirm complete operational success without residual dependencies."
