        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The HTTP DELETE request returned code 200 with \"success\":true, definitively confirming device removal. Post-deletion system behavior aligns with standard operational protocols: Subsequent deviceInfo and scheduleTips queries (HTTP 200 responses) verify the absence of target device data, while MQTT property updates with timer resets to 0 demonstrate comprehensive state synchronization across subsystems after removal. These coordinated actions constitute expected post-removal verification and cleanup processes rather than indications of partial execution."
