Reason: Multiple independent analyses confirm the POST request to /mos/share/v1/devices consistently returned HTTP 200 status code with \"success\":true in the response body. This pattern across all reports indicates unambiguous server acceptance of the sharing operation, with the combination of a 2xx status code and explicit success flag demonstrating proper cloud acknowledgment of the local device sharing process."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: All evaluations concur that despite proper user ownership, the second POST request to the same endpoint returned \"success\":false paired with an obscured HTTP error code. The consistent presence of failure indicators across all reports suggests persistent server-side rejection, likely due to either temporary system limitations (e.g., rate limiting), invalid parameter formatting in subsequent requests, or attempted duplicate sharing that violates platform business rules."
