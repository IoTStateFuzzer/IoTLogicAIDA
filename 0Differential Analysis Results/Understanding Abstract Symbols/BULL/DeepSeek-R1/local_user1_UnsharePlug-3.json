        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis confirms the POST request to /mos/share/v1/devices/cancel consistently returned HTTP 200 status code with \"success\":true in the payload. This dual confirmation of status code and explicit success flag demonstrates definitive cloud-side processing of the unshare operation. While some observations note unrelated background requests (e.g., scheduleTips GET) and potential payload decoding artifacts, these supplementary details do not contradict the core evidence of successful completion. The uniformity across all reports strengthens confidence in the outcome despite minor contextual variations in documentation."
