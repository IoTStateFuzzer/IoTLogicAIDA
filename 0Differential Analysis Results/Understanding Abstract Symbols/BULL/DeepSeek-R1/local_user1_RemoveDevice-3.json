        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis shows the DELETE request consistently achieved HTTP 200 status with \"success\":true confirmation in all reports. Technical corroboration exists through multiple verification methods: 1) Platform-level confirmation via subsequent GET requests showing device status updates 2) Device-level confirmation through MQTT property updates with cleared timer settings (PowerSwitch_LocalTimer) and PowerSwitch=0 state 3) System coherence between API response success and downstream IoT protocol updates, confirming complete device deregistration and state reset. The operation's success is validated through both immediate API response and post-removal system behavior checks."
