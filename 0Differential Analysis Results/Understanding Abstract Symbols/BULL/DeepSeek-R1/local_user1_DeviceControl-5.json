        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Multiple consistent indicators confirm successful operation: The HTTP PUT response code 200 with 'success': true demonstrates cloud-level command acceptance. Subsequent MQTT messages (PowerSwitch:0 and PowerSwitch:1) on the device-specific /app/down/thing/properties topic verify bidirectional state synchronization between cloud and device through local network channels. The alternating values confirm actual property updates were propagated via IoT protocol, with no error responses observed in any analysis. This dual-layer confirmation (HTTP API success + MQTT state changes) validates complete execution flow from cloud command initiation to device-level implementation."
