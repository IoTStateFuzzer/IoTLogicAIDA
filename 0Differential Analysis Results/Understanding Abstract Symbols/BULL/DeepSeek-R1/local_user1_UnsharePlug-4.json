        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The POST request to /mos/share/v1/devices/cancel endpoint returned HTTP 200 status code with \"success\":true in the response payload, which conclusively confirms the unshare operation was processed successfully by the cloud server. The subsequent GET request to scheduleTips appears to be an independent background synchronization process unrelated to the cancellation workflow, and does not impact the core operational success. While one instance mentioned a garbled message field, this was not reflected in other entries and likely represents a non-critical display artifact rather than an actual service failure."
