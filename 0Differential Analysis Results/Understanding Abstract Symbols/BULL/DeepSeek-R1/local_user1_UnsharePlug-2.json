        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis confirms the POST request to /mos/share/v1/devices/cancel consistently returned HTTP 200 status code with \"success\":true in the payload across all evaluations. This unanimous agreement demonstrates the cloud server properly processed the unshare operation. While some reports mention an ancillary GET request to /scheduleTips, this activity is logically decoupled from the cancellation workflow and likely represents routine background synchronization rather than an indicator of operational success."
