        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The POST request to /mos/share/v1/devices consistently returned HTTP 200 status code with \"success\":true across all analyses. This unanimous agreement confirms the operation was fully processed by the cloud infrastructure, whether interpreted as device sharing or plug sharing. The 200 code and explicit success flag indicate proper endpoint functionality and successful execution at both local and cloud levels."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: All analyses agree the POST request returned \"success\":false with obscured error codes, likely falling within 4xx/5xx ranges. This pattern indicates systemic failure in request processing, potentially involving authorization issues (invalid permissions), parameter validation errors, or server-side conflicts. The consistency across multiple observations suggests the cloud infrastructure actively rejected the request rather than encountering transient errors."
