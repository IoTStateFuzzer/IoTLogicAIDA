Technical evidence includes MQTT downlink messages demonstrating PowerSwitch state transitions (0\u21921), device property propagation patterns, and validation of temporary user permissions through cloud-side command processing. The multi-protocol correlation between HTTP acceptance and MQTT execution confirms complete control flow success."

Technical assessment notes the absence of new MQTT messages indicates protocol-level command acknowledgement completion rather than new device state changes. Cloud infrastructure behavior patterns suggest successful command re-verification without requiring additional device communication."
