        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The cloud service confirmed command acceptance through HTTP 200 response with 'success': true, while MQTT message propagation via /app/down/thing/properties demonstrated effective local execution - evidenced by sequential PowerSwitch value transitions (0 and 1). This dual-layer confirmation (cloud acceptance and device-level implementation) validates the complete control cycle without error indicators. The redundant verification across network layers ensures operational integrity beyond singular protocol confirmation."
