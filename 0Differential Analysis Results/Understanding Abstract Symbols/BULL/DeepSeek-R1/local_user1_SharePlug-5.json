        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The POST request to /mos/share/v1/devices consistently returned HTTP 200 status code and \"success\":true in the payload across all observations. This confirms the cloud service successfully processed the plug sharing request, with evidence of proper protocol adherence and system acceptance. The recurring mention of cloud processing and local execution alignment indicates a robust implementation of the sharing mechanism."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: Multiple instances of the POST request to /mos/share/v1/devices returned \"success\":false despite identical endpoint targeting. The failure pattern suggests systemic issues beyond transient network errors, with consensus around authorization conflicts (permission errors), parameter validity challenges, and potential server-side rejection mechanisms. The obscured error codes and temporal context (occurring after initial success) further indicate state-dependent conflicts rather than isolated incidents."
