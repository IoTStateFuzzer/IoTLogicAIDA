        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: Even though the first packet indicates a successful device share acceptance with a 200 HTTP status and a true success flag, the majority of attempts failed. Analyzing the reasons for failure, it appears that subsequent attempts were unsuccessful due to potentially repeated confirmations or invalid parameters, as well as a lack of a clear success indication in the follow-up post requests. The presence of multiple errors and the 'success': false flags in subsequent traffic packets suggest a failure in the overall operation to confirm device sharing, outweighing the single initial success."
