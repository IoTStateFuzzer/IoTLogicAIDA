Reason: The operation had a successful run as indicated by the server's return code '200' which usually signifies 'OK', and the 'success' field in the payload was also 'true'. This operational success is supported by the execution of a remote control operation by 'user2' on a device as evidenced by the HTTP response and MQTT traffic. There was a successful HTTP PUT request made to 'api.iotbull.com' and it was further confirmed by alterations in device properties where 'PowerSwitch' property was changed."

This assertion is backed by repeated HTTP traffic with a status code of '200' and the 'success' flag in the JSON payload set to 'true'. Further evidence of the successful operation is provided by repeated HTTP PUT requests to 'api.iotbull.com'. While there's an absence of specifics regarding the change in state or manipulated properties in certain packets, the consistent server-side processing of these packets confirms operational success."
