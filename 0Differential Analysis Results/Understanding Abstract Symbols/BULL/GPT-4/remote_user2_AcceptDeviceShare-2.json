Reason: Analyzing the first traffic packet, it is clear that the operation was successful as deduced from the HTTP status code 200 and 'success': true in the payload. This success code, typically used to indicate that the request was understood and processed correctly, alongside a true success value, unequivocally indicates that 'user2' managed to accept the shared device remotely from 'user1'."

Despite the obfuscation preventing the visualization of the exact error code, the presence of the false success value strongly signals an operation failure during the acceptance of the device share by 'user2'."
