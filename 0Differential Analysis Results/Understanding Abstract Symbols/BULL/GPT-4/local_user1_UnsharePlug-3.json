        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The unanimous consensus across all descriptions points towards the successful unsharing of the plug, primarily evidenced by HTTP 200 status codes in POST requests to the /mos/share/v1/devices/cancel endpoint. Each description emphasizes the critical role of this POST request in confirming the operation's success, with the 'success': true response further reinforcing this outcome. The references to traffic captures, API calls to the iotbull server, and specific endpoints underscore a thorough examination of the network communications, consistently leading to the conclusion that the operation was executed as intended. The incidental mention of a GET request to a different endpoint, while not directly related to the unsharing operation, does not detract from the focused analysis on the definitive cues of success found within the POST request responses."
