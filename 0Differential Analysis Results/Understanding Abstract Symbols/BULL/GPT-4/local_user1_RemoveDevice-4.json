It was marked by a DELETE request with status code 200 and 'success':true, followed by successful GET requests, suggesting a smoothly executed removal operation by the user. Notably, the persistence of device information after its removal was ascribed to potential latency rather than a failure of the operation. Furthermore, the 'thing.properties' method call in the MQTT packet, indicating a potential reset of 'PowerSwitch_LocalTimer', also lends support to the successful removal of the device. This range of evidence concretely affirms the success of the device removal operation."
