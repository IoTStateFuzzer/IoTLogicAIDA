        "Operation result: Success. Reason: For this operation, analysis indicates that a successful HTTP POST request was made to the 'share devices' endpoint (/mos/share/v1/devices) on the api.iotbull.com platform. Key success indicators were the return of a 200 status code, which typically signifies a successful HTTP request, and a payload entry 'success:true'. Regardless of the other requests found in the traffic, such as the GET request to the '/mos/schedule/v1/mHXk6DR3zDiKDwQd4vRo000000/scheduleTips' endpoint, the primary operation was a POST request related to sharing of the plug (as depicted by the action name). Given these markers, the operation appears to be successful."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: In the traffic for this operation, there's an HTTP POST request made to the 'share devices' endpoint (/mos/share/v1/devices) similarly to the previous operation. However, the 'success' field in the payload was set to 'false', indicating that the intended operation did not execute successfully. Although there was also a successful GET request to the '/mos/schedule/v1/mHXk6DR3zDiKDwQd4vRo000000/scheduleTips' endpoint, the key operation concerning the sharing of the plug is indicated by the POST request, which was unsuccessful. The exact error details are unspecified due to missing error code and detailed error message in the payload."
