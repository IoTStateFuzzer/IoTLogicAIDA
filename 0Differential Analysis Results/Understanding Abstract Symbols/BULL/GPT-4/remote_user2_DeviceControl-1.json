This conclusion is confirmed by several elements: Firstly, the HTTP 200 status code shows that the PUT request to the server at api.iotbull.com was successful. Secondly, the server returned a 'Success: True' message, further indicating a successful operation. Lastly, two MQTT packets contain 'thing.properties', keys 'PowerSwitch' were set to 0 and 1, which validate that user2 successfully altered the device property."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: All analysis agree that user2 successfully performed an operation to change the device property. This is once again confirmed by the server's successful HTTP 200 response to a PUT request on api.iotbull.com. Furthermore, the server's return message, 'Success: True', adds more weight to the successful outcome of the operation. Taken together, these pieces of evidence provide a compelling argument that user2 has effectively managed to control the device property remotely."
