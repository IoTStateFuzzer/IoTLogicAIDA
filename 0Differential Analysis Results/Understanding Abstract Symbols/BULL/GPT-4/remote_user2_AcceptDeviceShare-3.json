Reason: The first device sharing operation between users is confirmed successful through traffic analysis, revealing a 200 response code and a 'success': true indication.

Reason: The analysis of the second set of traffic data collectively indicates a failure in the operation due to an unsuccessful API request, highlighted by a 'success': false status. The consistency among the reasons such as an obfuscated, missing status code, or explicit failure flag, delineates a clear-cut operation failure."

Reason: The third traffic analysis unambiguously demonstrates a continuation of operation failures, as evidenced by the recurring 'success': false status in the payload.
