        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The comprehensive analysis of traffic, HTTP requests, and payload information clearly indicates that the device share operation initiated by user1 through the local channel was successful. All documentation points toward a series of successful network interactions, primarily through HTTP POST requests to the endpoint '/mos/share/v1/devices', which consistently returned a status code of 200 and a success indicator in the payload. This is confirmed across multiple pieces of evidence, including the success:true tag and encrypted messages showing no data return but a positive success field. Preliminary steps or checks, like the HTTP GET request for schedule tips, further corroborate that the necessary preparations for the sharing operation were successfully completed."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: The assembled data from various traffic payloads and HTTP requests clearly demonstrates a failure in the attempt by user1 to share a device plug through the local channel. Contrary to successful attempts which return a 200 status code and a success indicator, this operation is characterized by a critical unsuccessful HTTP POST request to '/mos/share/v1/devices', where the lack of a 200 status code and the explicit presence of a success:false tag in the response payload underscore the operation's failure. Despite a successful preliminary HTTP GET request for schedule tips, similar to the successful operation's initial step, the pivotal sharing operation's failure is evidently marked by either an obscured failure status code or directly by a false success flag, alongside encrypted error messages, signifying an ineffective execution of the intended share operation."
