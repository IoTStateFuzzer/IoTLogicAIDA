This is substantiated by the consistent return of an HTTP status code 200 across all recorded data entries, which constitutes a universal indication of operational success. Furthermore, the 'success' field in the traffic data consistently testifies to the operation's success. Hence, the user has successfully shared the device control."

This was ascertained through the consistent return of 'false' in the 'success' field in the payloads of the POST request to '/mos/share/v1/devices'. Moreover, some entries mentioned the absence of a success status code (HTTP 200), which further bolsters the indication of the operation's unsuccessful execution."
