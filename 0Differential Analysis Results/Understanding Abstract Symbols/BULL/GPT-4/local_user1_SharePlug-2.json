        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The unanimous consensus is that the operation was successful. The primary reasons cited include the HTTP status code 200 confirming the success of both the GET and POST requests, and corroborated by the fact that the 'success' field contained in the payload is set to true. Additionally, all reports point to the absence of error or failure messages. This leads to the conclusion that the device sharing operation carried out by User1 was successful."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: The majority agree upon a failure in the operation, as indicated by the payload's 'success' field set to false and the absence of an HTTP response code. It is inferred from this that the POST request failed in its intent to share the plug. This inconsistency, coupled with the presence of an encoded error message further solidifies the conclusion of a failed operation."
