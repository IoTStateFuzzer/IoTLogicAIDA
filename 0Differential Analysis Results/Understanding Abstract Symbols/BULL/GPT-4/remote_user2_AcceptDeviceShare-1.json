This is backed by the HTTP POST made to the specified endpoint of the server which resulted in a positive response with a '200' code and a successful status in the payload. The uniformity among these pieces of evidence strongly signals the operation's success."

Despite the POST to the same endpoint, the 'success' field in the payload was set to 'false', indicating the operation did not succeed. This suggests an underlying issue that is not explicitly stated in the traffic, but the overall suggestion of failure from the traffic data is clear."

The lack of details on the specific reason for failure is due to the payload obfuscation, but all indicators in the data suggest the operation by User2 indeed failed."
