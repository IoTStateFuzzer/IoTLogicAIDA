        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The analysis of traffic packets consistently shows that the operations undertaken were successful, with HTTP status code 200 observed across different packets. This code signals successful operations on the internet. Among these packets, distinct attention is drawn to those related to the UnsharePlug operation, evident through two main types of requests: a GET request fetching schedule information and a more crucial POST request aimed at canceling the sharing of an IoT device. The POST request, in particular, is highlighted across the analyses for directly impacting the UnsharePlug action by successfully canceling device sharing, as indicated by the 'success' field in its payload being true. Thus, the cancellation of device sharing (UnsharePlug operation) carried out by user1 is confirmed successful by the aligned evidence of HTTP 200 responses and the explicit success messages in the relevant packet payloads."
