        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic shows signs of a device being successfully removed. The third traffic payload with HTTP DELETE method to 'smarthome.hicloud.com' indicates an attempt to remove a device from a cloud service, which usually means that the device removal command was accepted. Further, the MQTT packet with a header indicating a 'deviceDeleted' notifyType confirms that the system recognized the device as removed. The absence of error messages or failed operation indicators in the traffic also supports the conclusion that the operation was successful."
