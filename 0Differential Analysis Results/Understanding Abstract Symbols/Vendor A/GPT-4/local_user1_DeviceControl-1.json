This is corroborated by the change of state in multiple services such as 'backlight', 'brightness', 'indicator', 'lightStatus', 'mainSwitch', 'mode', 'record', 'switch'. This aligns with typical device control patterns, further affirming the successful operation. These changes in the device's status, along with the mqtt traffic packets notifying the app of various device data changes, including the final states such as the main switch being turned on and different attributes being adjusted, reflect the device's effective control by user1."
