The changing states of various device functions hint at a successful execution of control commands. These states include the 'switch', 'brightness', 'mode' and other functionalities of the device. Furthermore, the successful operation is further cemented by the responses to the control commands indicating 'errcode: 0', meaning no errors occurred during the operation."

This error often indicates a 'Not Found' error suggesting that the requested resources, including specific devices or device services, were unattainable. Therefore, the server could not process user2's control command, resulting in the failure of the operation."
