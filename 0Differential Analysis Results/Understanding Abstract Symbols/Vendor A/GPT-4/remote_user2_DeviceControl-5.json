        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: The operations attempted by user2 resulted in failures, as unequivocally indicated by the error code '500000404'. This particular code, appearing consistently across MQTT messages, signals issues such as the inability to find the requested resource or the device, which could be due to incorrect device IDs or unrecognized commands. The absence of any traffic reflecting changes in device states corroborates the assertion that the command execution was unsuccessful. The conformity in the reasonings across different sources highlights a fundamental issue in locating the target device or service, thereby preventing user2 from executing the control operations as intended."
