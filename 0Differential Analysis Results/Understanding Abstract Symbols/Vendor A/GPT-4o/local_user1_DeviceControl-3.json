Reason: The traffic shows multiple successful updates and notifications related to various device attributes, such as brightness, main switch state, and light status, indicating the device responded correctly to the control commands. Additionally, the numerous MQTT traffic packets indicating 'deviceDataChanged' with specific state changes, as well as state change notifications received, confirm that multiple controlled states of the device have been communicated successfully without error responses. The device control operation by user locally also resulted in expected device status changes as observed in the subsequent MQTT notifications."
