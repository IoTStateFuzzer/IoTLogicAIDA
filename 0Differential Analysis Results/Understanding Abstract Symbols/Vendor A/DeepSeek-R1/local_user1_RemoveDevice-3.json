        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The operation succeeded due to coordinated confirmation signals across protocols: 1) HTTP DELETE request to '/smart-life/v2/devices/' verified cloud-side deletion, 2) MQTT notification with 'deviceDeleted' type confirmed backend propagation, 3) Local network confirmation through UDP/TCP packets containing 'delDevice' payloads and target device IDs, and 4) Subsequent device list queries returning empty arrays demonstrating persistent removal. The multi-protocol consistency (cloud API, MQTT broker, and local network commands) leaves no ambiguity about successful execution."
