        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis shows the DELETE request to remove member Abs_Len26 consistently returned HTTP 200 across all reports, confirming successful home member removal.

The POST request to privacy/data/report endpoints is unanimously identified as unrelated telemetry logging rather than an operational component, as it lacks connection to member removal mechanics."
