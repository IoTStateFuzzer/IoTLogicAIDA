        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The HTTP DELETE request to '/smart-life/v2/devices' demonstrates proper initiation of device removal at the cloud level. This is conclusively validated by the MQTT notification with 'deviceDeleted' type containing the specific devId, which serves as direct confirmation of successful system deregistration. Subsequent TCP/UDP packets referencing 'delDevice' in payloads and the 'devDataInfo' packet indicate complete data cleanup in local network operations. Final verification is provided by the HTTP GET request returning an empty devices array, confirming persistent removal from cloud records. The multi-protocol consistency across cloud API calls, real-time messaging (MQTT), and local network communications forms an irrefutable chain of evidence for successful device deletion."
