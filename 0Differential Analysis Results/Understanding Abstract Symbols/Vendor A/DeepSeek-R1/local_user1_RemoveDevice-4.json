        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consolidated analysis shows multiple confirmations of successful device deletion: 1) HTTP DELETE requests to cloud endpoints (`/smart-life/v2/devices/...` and smarthome.hicloud.com) confirm cloud-side removal; 2) MQTT 'deviceDeleted' notifications validate propagation across the IoT ecosystem; 3) Local TCP/UDP packets with 'delDevice' commands indicate successful execution of removal instructions on the device; 4) Subsequent empty device list responses (`/wisedevice/user-service/v3/devices`) and absence of error messages provide final verification of system-wide deletion. These interdependent technical signals collectively confirm comprehensive removal from cloud, local network, and MQTT infrastructure."
