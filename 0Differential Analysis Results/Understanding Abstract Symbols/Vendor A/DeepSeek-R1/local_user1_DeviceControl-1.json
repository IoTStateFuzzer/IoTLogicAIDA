        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consolidated analysis shows MQTT notifications consistently confirm three key device state changes - mainSwitch activation (1), switch activation (1), and brightness adjustment to 90. This is complemented by UDP protocol verification from device_0, which confirms local execution of commands through 'switch' status updates and devDataInfo headers. The convergence of both cloud (MQTT) and local (UDP) confirmation channels demonstrates successful command execution through the local control pathway."
