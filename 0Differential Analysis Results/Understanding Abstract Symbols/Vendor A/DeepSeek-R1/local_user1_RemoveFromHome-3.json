        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The DELETE request to /smart-life/v3/home/[ID]/member/ returned HTTP 200, confirming successful removal of member Abs_Len26. This is corroborated by the subsequent PUT request to update houseAuthChange parameters, which also returned 200 status code, demonstrating successful authorization changes. The POST request to /data/report represents unrelated analytics traffic and does not impact the core operation's success. Both critical operations (member removal and authorization update) were validated through standard HTTP success codes."
