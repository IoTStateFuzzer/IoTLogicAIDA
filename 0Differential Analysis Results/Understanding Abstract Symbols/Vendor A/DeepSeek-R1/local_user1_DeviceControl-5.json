        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consolidated analysis of MQTT communications and UDP packet evidence confirms successful device control. Multiple 'deviceDataChanged' notifications through MQTT (mainSwitch:1, switch:1, brightness:90) demonstrate synchronized state updates between local devices and the cloud platform. Complementary UDP packets from device_0 containing 'switch' operations and 'devDataInfo' headers provide physical-layer confirmation of command execution. The consistency across both application-layer messaging (MQTT) and transport-layer protocols (UDP), along with observed state toggling between on:0/1 states in multiple services, establishes redundant verification of successful command implementation through local network interactions."
