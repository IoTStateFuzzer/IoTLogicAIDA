        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis confirms the member removal succeeded through multiple technical validations. The DELETE request (HTTP 200) to /member/Abs_Len26 directly confirmed member removal from the home system. Authorization updates were then verified by the PUT request (HTTP 200) modifying houseAuthChange parameters, demonstrating proper permission cascade adjustments. While a POST privacy report request exists in logs, all evaluators concur it represents a peripheral audit trail unrelated to core operational success. The unanimous agreement across all analysis threads reinforces the conclusion that both member deletion and authorization updates were fully executed at API level."
