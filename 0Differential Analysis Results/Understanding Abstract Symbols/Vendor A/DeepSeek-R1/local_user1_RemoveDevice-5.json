        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The operation demonstrates coordinated cloud-device synchronization through three distinct validation layers: 1) Cloud infrastructure confirmation via HTTP DELETE request to '/smart-life/v2/devices/' endpoint at smarthome.hicloud.com; 2) System-wide event propagation evidenced by MQTT 'deviceDeleted' notification containing specific devId/gatewayId parameters; 3) Local protocol execution confirmed through TCP/UDP packets with 'delDevice' commands in payload. Final verification via empty device list in subsequent HTTP GET request confirms persistent state change. This multi-protocol alignment (HTTP\u2192MQTT\u2192TCP/UDP) across network layers constitutes conclusive evidence of successful removal."
