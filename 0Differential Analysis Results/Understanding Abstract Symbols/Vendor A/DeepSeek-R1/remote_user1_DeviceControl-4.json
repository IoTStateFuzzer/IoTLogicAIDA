        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis confirms all reports show MQTT commandRsp responses with errcode 0 (universal success code), accompanied by deviceDataChanged notifications verifying state changes.

These layered acknowledgments demonstrate successful command execution at protocol level (errcode validation) and physical device state synchronization."
