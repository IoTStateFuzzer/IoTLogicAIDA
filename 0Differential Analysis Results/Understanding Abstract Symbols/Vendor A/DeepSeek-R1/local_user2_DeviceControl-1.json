Reason: Consensus analysis of 5/5 reports confirms device control success through consistent MQTT evidence (switch status changes to on/1 and off/0, brightness adjustments) and UDP packet confirmations from device_0. Local channel execution is validated despite isolated authentication errors in unrelated HTTP services, which don't impact device command execution."

Precise time-stamped record updates (time=76) and device-specific confirmation traffic eliminate ambiguity about command execution."
