        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The consistent traffic data across the materials reveals a successful HTTP POST request made to the api.mijia.tech server, specifically to the /app/user/del_owner_device_batch endpoint. This endpoint corresponds to the RemoveDevice operation, indicating an intention to remove a device from an account, in this case, 'user1'. What's instrumental in corroborating the operation's success is the response received, which carries a 'code' of 0 accompanied by a 'message' of 'ok'. This is noteworthy as our analysis aligns with the typical convention that attributes the code '0' with successful API operations. We also find 'result' values that signify operation success in respective terms. Furthermore, while we do notice traffic related to 'device_0' comprising background packets, it holds no significant implication on the outcome of the main operation. These packets appear to be part of routine device communications or updates, thereby concluding the RemoveDevice operation was successful."
