        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic includes successful POST requests to the 'eventsub' and 'eventunsub' endpoints with positive responses, indicating successful subscription and unsubscription to device events, which is consistent with remote device control. Additionally, the 'fetch_sdk' and 'get_standard_operation' requests returned successful results, showing that user2 effectively managed to control the device remotely and retrieve necessary SDK details, standard operation configurations, and vendor information, suggesting the operation execution by user2 as the attacker was successful."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: This set of traffic shows repeated successful API interactions similar to the first set, with effective responses from 'eventsub', 'eventunsub', 'fetch_sdk', and 'get_standard_operation'. The persistent positive outcomes in API calls imply that user2 maintained control over the device through remote operations, successfully manipulating device settings and configurations as evidenced by the success messages and payloads."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consistent with the previous sets, the traffic reveals successful API responses related to device event management and SDK operations. The successful 'eventsub' and 'eventunsub' calls and the detailed information fetched from 'get_standard_operation' and 'fetch_sdk' indicate user2's continued remote control and manipulation of the device settings, further supported by successful vendor information retrieval. The operation by user2 as the attacker was executed successfully."
