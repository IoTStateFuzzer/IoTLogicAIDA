        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The analysis consistently identifies successful device sharing operations across all provided details. The success is evidenced by several factors such as successful API calls ('share_request' marked 'true'), positive server responses ('\"code\":0,\"message\":\"ok\",\"result\":\"true\"'), and the lack of errors or block lists impacting the share. The details provided, including HTTP POST requests to pertinent endpoints and the retrieval of shared device and user information, collectively confirm the operation's success. These factors are not negated by any irrelevant packets or data unrelated to the sharing process, therefore establishing a unanimous conclusion of success."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: Despite initial indications of a successful sharing operation in some traffic analyses, the majority of the provided reasons point towards failure. The predominant evidence for this conclusion comes from server responses indicating that the share permission already exists ('result: have share permit' with a code of '-11'), suggesting that the operation was redundant. This redundancy implies that no new sharing action was successfully completed, as attempting to share again with an already permitted user does nothing to change the sharing status. Thus, the operation's objective was not achieved, making these attempts unsuccessful despite activities that might suggest otherwise."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: All analyses unequivocally indicate failure in the sharing operation, as evidenced by server responses ('\"code\":-12,\"message\":\"false\",\"result\":\"false\"'), directly stating the operation's failure. This is further corroborated by the absence of successful outcomes in the described traffic, including lack of successful share request completions. The consensus is that the sharing operation did not succeed due to issues potentially related to processing errors or restrictions on sharing permissions. The uniformity of the failure indicators, such as the specific error codes and the 'false' result, strongly supports this conclusion without ambiguity."
