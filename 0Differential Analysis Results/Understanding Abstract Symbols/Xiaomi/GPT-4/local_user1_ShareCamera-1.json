The consistent presence of 'code':0, 'message':'ok' or 'message':'OK', and result showing as 'true' in the 'share_request' responses confirm this. In addition, other related actions like device shares listing and user sharing requests also return a status code of zero, which signifies success. Evidently, a new share permission was created where previously none existed, illustrating that the control of the device has indeed been shared."

Predominantly, the 'share_request' responses carried a 'code': -11 and a 'message':'have share permit', which implies failure as the user already has share permissions for the device. This suggests either a redundancy or mishandling in operations. All other operations before sharing indicated success, however, the sharing process itself failed because the share permission existed already."

Each input indicated a failed 'share_request' with a code: -12 and a message:'false', suggesting an unsuccessful operation. All the previously successful requests including getting user information and device share listing seemed superfluous, as the final 'share_request' returned negatively. The issue might be associated with incorrect operation parameters, system limitations or share permissions problems."
