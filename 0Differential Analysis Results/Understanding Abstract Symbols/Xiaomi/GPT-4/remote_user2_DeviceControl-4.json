        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Similar to the previous traffic set, the responses from event subscription and unsubscription, SDK information retrieval, and device control operations confirm that user2 has successfully utilized their remote access to control the device. Each response indicates operational success with positive outcomes in the respective payloads."
