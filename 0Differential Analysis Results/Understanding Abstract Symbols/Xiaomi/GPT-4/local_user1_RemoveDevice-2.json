        "Operation result: Success. Reason: All strings indicate a successful removal of a device that was performed through a POST request to 'del_owner_device_batch' of 'api.mijia.tech'. This conclusion is supported by a server response showing 'code' as 0 and 'message' as 'ok', both of which imply success. In addition, one of the key factors supporting this successful removal operation is the 'result' label associated with device ID 369647111, which shows a status of '1'. The traffic details without payload are device feedbacks that don't indicate any operation error."
