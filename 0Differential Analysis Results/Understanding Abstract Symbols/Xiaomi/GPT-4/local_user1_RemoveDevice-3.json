        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic clearly indicates through a POST request to the designated domain api.mijia.tech on the endpoint /app/user/del_owner_device_batch that the user has successfully carried out a device removal operation. The traffic packet comes with a success code of 0, and a confirmatory message of 'ok'. Moreover, in the payload of the first traffic packet, the value corresponding to the device ID '369647111' is '1', denoting the successful removal of the device. Further analysis reinforces the operation's success, even as subsequent packets merely relay acknowledgement messages from the device and do not house any more pertinent information on the successful operation."
