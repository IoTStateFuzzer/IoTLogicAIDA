This is supported primarily by the presence of 'code': 0 and standard operation details in the JSON payloads returned from 'api.mijia.tech'. The successful operation is further indicated by the presence of payloads with 'user1_remote' in the header, suggesting active communication between the user's command and the device. Furthermore, the presence of device-specific payload configurations such as 'pppp_stream_payload' indicates the device's functionality was activated and operational. Importantly, there are no indications of errors or abnormal terminations in the traffic."
