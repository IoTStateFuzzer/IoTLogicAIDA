        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The collective evidence from the traffic analysis clearly indicates that the operation to unshare a camera executed by user1 was successful. The operation involved communicating with 'api.mijia.tech' at the '/app/share/delete_user' endpoint, where the server's response with 'code': 0 and 'message': 'ok' strongly suggests a lack of errors and a successful outcome. This result is further validated by additional checks demonstrating an empty sharing list, hinting at the successful removal of shared users, and showing a 'ret': 1 under 'result,' which implies that the operation\u2019s execution was indeed successful. The consistent return of success codes across different analyses and the detailed verification through traffic payloads, including confirmation of the camera's unsharing by device ID '369647111', collectively affirm the operation's success without encountering any errors."
