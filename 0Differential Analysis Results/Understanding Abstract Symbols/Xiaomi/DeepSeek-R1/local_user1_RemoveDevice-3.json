        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The HTTP POST API response code 0 (universal success indicator in IoT protocols) combined with the explicit 'ok' message and device-specific confirmation ('369647111':1) in the payload conclusively demonstrate successful batch removal. Subsequent device_0 packets (19/224/225 sequence) with empty payloads represent standard Mijia protocol acknowledgments, where packet 19 initiates removal, 224 confirms command receipt, and 225 finalizes device-state synchronization - completing the removal workflow at both cloud and local levels."
