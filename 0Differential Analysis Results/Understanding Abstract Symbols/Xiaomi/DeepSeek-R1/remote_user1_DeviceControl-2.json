        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Consensus analysis confirms success through multiple evidential layers: 1) All HTTP POST responses (api.mijia.tech/core.api.mijia.tech) consistently return code 0, validating cloud-side authentication, device configuration integrity, and vendor metadata retrieval. 2) Sustained PPPP protocol activity with stream payloads demonstrates an established peer-to-peer control channel, evidenced by bidirectional communication between user1_remote and device_0 without error flags. 3) Temporal sequencing shows command execution precedes stable stream formation, confirming causal relationship between control signals and operational response. The combination of API success codes and persistent encrypted streaming payloads provides dual confirmation of remote control functionality."
