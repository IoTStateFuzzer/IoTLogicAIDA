        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The HTTP POST responses from both api.mijia.tech and core.api.mijia.tech consistently returned code 0 ('success'/'ok'), confirming valid authentication and successful retrieval of device configurations/vendor credentials. Subsequent PPPP protocol traffic (including 'pppp_stream_payload' packets and control port acknowledgments on ports 19, 208, 224, 225) demonstrated a stable peer-to-peer connection for real-time data streaming and remote command execution between user1_remote and device_0. The absence of error flags in headers/payloads, coupled with active bidirectional interactions aligned with Xiaomi ecosystem behaviors, conclusively indicates successful remote control establishment."
