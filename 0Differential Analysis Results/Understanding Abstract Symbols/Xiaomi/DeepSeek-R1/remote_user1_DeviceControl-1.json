        "Operation result: Success. Reason: Unified analysis of cloud responses and device communication confirms success. Both api.mijia.tech and core.api.mijia.tech returned HTTP code 0 (standard success indicator) for configuration retrieval and vendor authentication. Subsequent PPPP protocol traffic demonstrated sustained streaming payloads (pppp_stream_payload) and status code 208, confirming persistent P2P control channel maintenance between user1_remote and device_0. No error flags or termination patterns were observed in protocol exchanges, consistent with successful remote command execution and session continuity."
