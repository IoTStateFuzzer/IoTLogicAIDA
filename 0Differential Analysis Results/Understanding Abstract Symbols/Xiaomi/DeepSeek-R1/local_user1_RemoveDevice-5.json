        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The HTTP POST response from api.mijia.tech explicitly returned code 0 (universal success indicator) accompanied by message 'ok' and payload {'result':{'369647111':1}}, confirming successful removal of the specified device ID. Subsequent device_0 packets (status codes 19/224/225) with empty payloads represent protocol-level acknowledgments, consistent with standard IoT device behavior where disconnection signals and routine status updates typically follow a successful deletion operation. The combination of API response validation and downstream network activity patterns conclusively demonstrates proper system execution."
