Reason: HTTP POST requests to both api.mijia.tech and core.api.mijia.tech returned code 0 (success), confirming valid retrieval of device control configurations and vendor authentication.

The absence of error codes in headers/payloads, combined with sustained bidirectional communication, confirms a fully established remote control channel with continuous data flow and operational integrity."
