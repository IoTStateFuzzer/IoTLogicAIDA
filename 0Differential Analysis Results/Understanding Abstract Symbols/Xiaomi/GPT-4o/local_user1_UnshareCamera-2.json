        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic captures a sequence of server interactions indicating a successful unsharing operation. Vital packets include responses from the 'api.mijia.tech' domain with POST requests to '/app/share/delete_user' and '/app/share/device_share_list', which return 'code\":0' and the message 'OK', confirming the removal of the shared user and reflecting accurate updates to the shared device list. Other packets, such as requests to 'api.account.xiaomi.com', seem unrelated to the specific unsharing operation."
