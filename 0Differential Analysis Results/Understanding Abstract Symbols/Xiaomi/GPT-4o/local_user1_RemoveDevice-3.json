        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The majority of analyses confirm that the removal operation was successful, evidenced by the consistent presence of a response from the cloud server (api.mijia.tech) which includes a code indicating success ('0') and a message ('ok'). This consistent pattern across the data packets validates the successful execution of the device removal operation. The minor presence of packets with 'payload_is_None' is identified as unrelated system traffic, not impacting the operation. The device ID has been confirmed as removed by user1, reinforcing the successful completion of the task."
