        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The traffic analysis and server responses consistently indicate a successful remote device control operation initiated by user1. The response packets from 'api.mijia.tech' and 'core.api.mijia.tech' confirm the execution without errors, as evidenced by the consistent 'code': 0 and 'message':'success' across multiple entries. Additionally, the device model's capabilities and configurations were properly processed, resulting in a coherent success confirmation throughout the operation. The presence of clear payloads and absence of error messages further solidify the successful execution of the device control command."
