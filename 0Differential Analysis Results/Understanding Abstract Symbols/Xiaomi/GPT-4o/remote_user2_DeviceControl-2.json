The presence of packets from user2_remote with 'l': 'suc' further suggests successful control of the device by user2. There are also 'plugin fetch' and 'standard operation' packets indicating device operations were fetched and understood, supporting the conclusion of a successful operation."

Packets from user2_remote contain indications of success, and the presence of device vendor and operation details further emphasizes normal processing and executing control commands, demonstrating the successful device control operation by user2."
