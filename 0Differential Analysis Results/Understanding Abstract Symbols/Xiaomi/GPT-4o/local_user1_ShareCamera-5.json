Reason: The majority of the evidence points to a successful share operation in which the traffic and API responses from 'api.mijia.tech' confirmed the successful retrieval and validation of user details with a result of 'true'. The responses consistently indicated that both user information and shared device listings were successfully processed, verifying the share operation as completed successfully."

        "Operation result: Failed. Reason: The primary consensus indicates that the sharing operation failed because the system identified an existing sharing permit, preventing the new operation. This failure was consistently described with an error code '-11' and the message 'have share permit', suggesting that the presence of ongoing sharing permissions halted further sharing attempts."

The responses from 'api.mijia.tech' consistently returned an error code '-12' with the message 'false', suggesting the failure was due to restriction or execution errors, with indications of authorization or process-related issues preventing successful completion."
