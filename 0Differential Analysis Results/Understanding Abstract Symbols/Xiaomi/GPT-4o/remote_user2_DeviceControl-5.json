This is evidenced by multiple packets containing successful status messages like 'result: {\"ret\": true}' and 'code 0', alongside sequences that typically follow a successful device control operation. Although there are unrelated packets concerning plugin SDKs and other metadata operations, essential indicators for successful device control are present within the user2_remote labelled packets."
