Reason: The relevant traffic for user2's remote control attempt shows a successful response from the API with multiple instances of the message \"ok\" and indications of success (\"ret\": true) for subscription actions. Additionally, the packets associated with user2's remote operation contain sequences indicative of a successful outcome, such as \"ult\":\"success\", suggesting that the device control operation was effectively executed remotely."

Reason: As with the previous set, user2's interaction with the system shows successful indications in both subscription and control operations, with repeated returns of positive acknowledgment (\"ok\" and \"ret\": true). This consistent pattern of successful messages across multiple packets, including during standard operation fetching and vendor queries, supports the conclusion that user2 successfully performed the remote DeviceControl operation."

        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The consistent pattern across the third set of traffic reiterates successful execution cues, echoing those in the first two sets. User2 receives positive responses during the operation process, reinforcing the indication that remote control over the device was achieved without hindrance."
