        "Operation result: Success. Reason: The analysis of the traffic confirms successful device control operations via a remote channel, as deduced from multiple indicators including successful communication with 'api.mijia.tech' and 'core.api.mijia.tech'. The repeated appearance of success codes '0' and messages such as 'success' or 'ok' from server responses corroborate that standard operations, commands, and vendor data retrieval were effectively processed. While there were packets with 'payload_is_None' and other unrelated data, these are interpreted as background processes or keep-alive signals, thereby not affecting the successful outcome of remote device control."
