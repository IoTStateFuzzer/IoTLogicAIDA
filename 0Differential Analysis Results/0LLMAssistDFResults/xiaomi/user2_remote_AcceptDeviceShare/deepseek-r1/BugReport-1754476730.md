### Divergent model
*   **Vulnerability 1: Family Membership Status Leakage via Differential Error Messaging**  
    **Impact:** Attackers can infer false family membership status and system relationship configurations through error message variations. This violates confidentiality by exposing system state information through differential error patterns (CLS_2 "already in room" vs CLS_1 "invalid request"), enabling attackers to distinguish between direct-sharing permissions and erroneous family-relationship indications. The leakage persists even when users only have direct sharing permissions, potentially revealing permission configurations that should remain hidden.

    **Problematic State(s):**  
        *   `s8`: Performed **user2|remote|AcceptDeviceShare**, received **error with 'already in room' message (CLS_2)**, transitioned to **State s8**, causing **information leakage through unique error symbol patterns that falsely imply family membership status. The distinct response contrasts with CLS_1 errors in other states (s4/s5/s6), allowing attackers to differentiate between invalid request scenarios and erroneous family relationship assumptions while operating under direct sharing permissions**.
