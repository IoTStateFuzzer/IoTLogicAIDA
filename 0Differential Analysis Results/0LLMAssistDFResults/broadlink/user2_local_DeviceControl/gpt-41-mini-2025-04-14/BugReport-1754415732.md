# Bug Reports
## Base model
No issues found.

## Divergent model
* **Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Device Control by User2 without Family Membership or Accepted Invitation**  
*Impact:*  
User2, who is neither a family member nor has accepted the family invitation, is able to perform unauthorized device control operations in multiple states (e.g., `s15`, `s29`, `s30`, `s32`). This unauthorized control enables user2 to execute local and remote DeviceControl commands successfully, violating fundamental access control permissions. The vulnerability undermines device confidentiality by exposing sensitive device functions to unauthorized parties, compromises integrity by allowing unauthorized commands that could alter or misuse device behavior, and jeopardizes availability by enabling potential disruptions of legitimate operations. This flaw constitutes a privilege escalation and improper access control vulnerability (CWE-284, CWE-732), allowing an attacker user to operate the device illegitimately.

*Problematic State(s):*  
- `s15`: User2 performed **local DeviceControl**, received **success response**, despite being an unaccepted family member; caused **unauthorized device control without formal permission**.  
- `s29`: User2 performed **remote DeviceControl** successfully after scanning but failing to accept the invitation; caused **unauthorized remote device control as a non-family member**.  
- `s30`: User2 performed **local and remote DeviceControl**, received **success responses**, without family membership or accepted invitation, causing **unauthorized device manipulation**.  
- `s32`: User2 performed **local DeviceControl**, received **success**, after multiple invitations and device re-additions but without acceptance, causing **persistent unauthorized control**.

* **Vulnerability 2: Persistence of Unauthorized Device Control after Device Removal by User1**  
*Impact:*  
Even after user1 removes the device (e.g., states `s16`, `s26`), user2 retains unauthorized device control privileges. Although subsequent attempts by user2 to perform DeviceControl may fail or receive empty/no responses, the persistence of control from previous unauthorized access reveals a lack of proper access revocation mechanisms. This persistence extends the window of exposure, enabling attackers to maintain control and circumvent explicit access removal actions, thus constituting a serious violation of access control policies and increasing risk of prolonged confidentiality, integrity, and availability breaches.

*Problematic State(s):*  
- `s16`: After device removal by user1, user2 retains unauthorized device control initially; DeviceControl requests later fail or yield no response, but prior unauthorized access was still effective.  
- `s26`: User1 removed the device, yet user2 maintains unauthorized local device control until quitting the home environment, demonstrating **improper persistent access**.

*Additional Notes:*  
- No direct or differential information leakage vulnerabilities have been identified in any report. Responses and error messages related to permission checks or invitation status consistently reveal only standard failure information without exposing sensitive internal attributes or user identities.  
- The unauthorized access issues arise fundamentally from flawed access control enforcement in the divergent model and do not occur in the base model.

**Summary:**  
The divergent model exhibits critical security vulnerabilities allowing user2—who lacks family membership and has not accepted invitations—to execute unauthorized local and remote device control operations, violating confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections. Furthermore, device removal by user1 does not effectively revoke these unauthorized controls, allowing attacker persistence. Immediate remediation is essential to enforce strict permission checks, validate invitation acceptance, and ensure robust access revocation to maintain device security and prevent privilege escalation.
