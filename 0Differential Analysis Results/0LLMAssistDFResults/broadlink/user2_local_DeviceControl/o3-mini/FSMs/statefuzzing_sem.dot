	s32 -> s32 [label="user1|local|DeviceControl / Symbol: CLS_0. Operation result: Undetermined. Evidence: **'user1_local'**. Reason: The majority of evidence shows packets with **'user1_local'** lacking explicit success indicators, while one report’s additional 'header' detail does not alter the consensus of insufficient confirmation for a complete DeviceControl exchange."];
	s32 -> s32 [label="user1|local|InviteToHome / Symbol: CLS_1. Operation result: Success. Evidence: 'qrcode':'11Abs_Len14|'. Reason: A consistent match of the QR code value '11Abs_Len14|' appears in the majority of responses, validating the invite operation despite additional unique details in some packets."];
	s32 -> s15 [label="user2|local|DeviceControl / Symbol: CLS_0. Operation result: Success. Evidence: **'/device/control/v2/sdkcontrol'**; **'Response'**. Reason: HTTP POST packets to the /device/control/v2/sdkcontrol endpoint uniformly delivered a Response indication, confirming that the control command executed properly."];
	s32 -> s32 [label="user2|remote|DeviceControl / Symbol: CLS_1. Operation result: Success. Evidence: **'Response'**. Reason: Consistent device control responses are indicated by the common occurrence of the 'Response' element in each packet, showing no error markers and confirming successful execution."];
	s32 -> s2 [label="user2|remote|AcceptInvite / NoElement"];
	s32 -> s32 [label="user2|remote|ScanQRCode / Symbol: CLS_2. Operation result: Failed. Evidence: ''error':-2011''. Reason: The payload’s repeated inclusion of error code -2011 consistently confirms the operation’s failure."];
	s32 -> s18 [label="user2|remote|QuitHome / Symbol: CLS_1. Operation result: Success. Evidence: '{'error':0,'status':0,'msg':'ok'}'. Reason: The explicit successful quitfamily payload indicates a clear successful outcome, with the evidence unambiguously showing error:0 and a message of 'ok'."];
