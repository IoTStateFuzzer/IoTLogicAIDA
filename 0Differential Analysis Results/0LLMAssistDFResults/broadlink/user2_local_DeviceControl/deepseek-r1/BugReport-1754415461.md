# Bug Reports


## Base model
*   No issues found.

## Divergent model
*   **Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Device Control by Non-Family Members**  
    **Impact:** Allows non-family members to persistently execute device control operations through local access, even after quitting the family or during device re-addition cycles. Violates confidentiality, integrity, and availability by enabling unauthorized command execution without valid permissions or family membership.  
    **Problematic State(s):**  
        *   `s19`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl**, received **CLS_0 (Success)**, transitioned to **State s19**, enabling repeated unauthorized operations after quitting the family.  
        *   `s20`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl**, received **CLS_0 (Success)**, transitioned to **State s19**, allowing initial unauthorized access despite never having family membership.  
        *   `s31`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl**, received **CLS_0 (Success)**, maintained in **State s31**, demonstrating control retention post-family removal.  
        *   `s30`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl**, received **CLS_0 (Success)**, transitioned to **State s30**, showing permissions persist through device removal/re-addition cycles.

*   **Vulnerability 2: State Inference via Differential Error Codes**  
    **Impact:** Protocol-level error code variations (-2010 vs -2011) leak family membership status and device authorization hierarchy, enabling attackers to infer sensitive system state information.  
    **Problematic State(s):**  
        *   `s5/s6`: Contrasting **CLS_1 (error:-2010)** vs **CLS_2 (error:-2011)** responses to ScanQRCode operations reveals whether User2 is a family member.  
        *   `s15/s32`: Differential **CLS_2 (error:-2011)** responses between member/non-member states expose authorization relationships.

*   **Vulnerability 3: Zombie Permission Retention**  
    **Impact:** Maintains control permissions after critical system changes including device removal, re-addition, and family membership revocation, violating permission timeliness and revocation policies.  
    **Problematic State(s):**  
        *   `s16`: After device removal (**s15→s16**), retains control capabilities despite device absence.  
        *   `s26/s29`: Device re-addition preserves inherited permissions without re-validation.  
        *   `s28`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl** after quitting family, received **CLS_5 (Undetermined)**, suggesting residual access potential despite non-member status.

*   **Vulnerability 4: Device/State Inference via Response Patterns**  
    **Impact:** Differential response types (CLS_NoResponse vs encrypted payloads, CLS_0 vs CLS_5) leak device presence, configuration history, and operational states through protocol symbol variations.  
    **Problematic State(s):**  
        *   `s15/s16`: **CLS_0 (Success)** vs **CLS_NoResponse** contrast reveals device presence/absence.  
        *   `s18`: **CLS_5 (Undetermined)** responses to control attempts expose device re-addition history.  
        *   `s30/s26`: Success/failure pattern differences indicate device state changes.  
        *   `s16 vs s7**: Empty response (CLS_NoResponse) vs encrypted payload enables invitation process inference.

*   **Vulnerability 5: Ambiguous Security State Propagation**  
    **Impact:** Undetermined responses (CLS_5) create ambiguous security states where attackers might retain partial control capabilities despite apparent permission revocation.  
    **Problematic State(s):**  
        *   `s18`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl**, received **CLS_5 (Undetermined)**, maintained state while suggesting potential control capability retention.  
        *   `s28**: CLS_5 response after explicit family removal creates uncertainty about effective permission revocation.
