	s32 -> s32 [label="user1|local|DeviceControl / Symbol: CLS_0. Operation result: Undetermined. Evidence: 'UDP traffic with encrypted payloads'; 'user1_local'; 'Pattern: Bidirectional traffic but insufficient response verification'. Reason: No explicit status codes in encrypted UDP payloads and missing device confirmation packet despite command traffic with header 'user1_local'. Insufficient traffic patterns prevent definitive status verification."];
	s32 -> s32 [label="user1|local|InviteToHome / Symbol: CLS_1. Operation result: Success. Evidence: ''error':0'; ''status':0'; ''msg':'ok''. Reason: QR invitation system functioning validated through consistent success indicators (status:0/error:0) with 'ok' confirmation in API payload, supplemented by secondary acceptance activity."];
	s32 -> s15 [label="user2|local|DeviceControl / Symbol: CLS_0. Operation result: Success. Evidence: 'name':'Response'; 'UDP exchange between device_0 and user2_local'; 'Bidirectional UDP'. Reason: Device control succeeded with HTTP status 0 and Response confirmations, reinforced by sustained bidirectional UDP exchanges exhibiting command-response structure absent error signals."];
	s32 -> s32 [label="user2|remote|DeviceControl / Symbol: CLS_1. Operation result: Success. Evidence: ''name':'Response''. Reason: Consistent payload evidence with 'Response' event identifiers across execution patterns, confirming successful command acknowledgment without error signatures in control traffic."];

	s32 -> s32 [label="user2|remote|ScanQRCode / Symbol: CLS_2. Operation result: Failed. Evidence: 'error':-2011,'status':-2011'. Reason: Protocol-level failure confirmed through negative error code -2011 with consistent status verification."];
	s32 -> s18 [label="user2|remote|QuitHome / Symbol: CLS_1. Operation result: Success. Evidence: 'error':0,'status':0,'msg':'ok'; 'status':0,'msg':'ok'. Reason: Success confirmation through status code 0 and 'ok' message, with variations showing the presence of additional 'error':0 field."];
