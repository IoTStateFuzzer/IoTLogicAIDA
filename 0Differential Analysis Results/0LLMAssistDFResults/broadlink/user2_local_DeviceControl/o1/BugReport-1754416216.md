# Bug Reports
## Base model
No issues found.

## Divergent model
* **Vulnerability 1: Ex-member retains unauthorized device control**  
* **Impact:**  
  Across all five reports, it is consistently shown that once user2 quits the home (thus losing membership and any direct sharing rights), they should no longer be able to control user1â€™s device. However, the state machine indicates multiple transitions in which user2, despite having no valid membership, can still successfully perform local device-control operations or at least does not receive a clear denial. This behavior violates the intended permission model and compromises the integrity and availability of the device, enabling an unauthorized user to potentially continue issuing commands and interfering with user1â€™s device operations.

* **Problematic State(s):**  
  â€¢ `s18`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl**, received **Undetermined** outcome (no explicit denial). Since user2 is outside the family, this ambiguity poses a risk of unauthorized control.  

  â€¢ `s19`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl (CLS_0)**, received **Success**, causing unauthorized device control by an ex-member.  

  â€¢ `s20 â†’ s19`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl (CLS_0)**, received **Success**, transitioning to s19 while user2 remains outside the family, enabling continued control.  

  â€¢ `s21`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl** with no explicit failure response (Undetermined). Again, user2 is not a member, so this raises the risk of unauthorized access.  

  â€¢ `s24`: Similarly, user2 performed **user2|local|DeviceControl** with an Undetermined outcome, indicating a possible lack of rejection for an ex-member.  

  â€¢ `s25 â†’ s19`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl (CLS_0)**, received **Success**, transitioning to s19. Although user2 was re-invited, membership was never re-accepted, so control remains unauthorized.  

  â€¢ `s31`: Performed **user2|local|DeviceControl (CLS_0)**, received **Success**, staying in s31 while user2 is still a non-member, indicating ongoing unauthorized device access.
