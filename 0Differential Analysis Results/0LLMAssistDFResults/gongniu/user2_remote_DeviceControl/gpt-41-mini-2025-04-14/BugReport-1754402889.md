# State Semantic
## Base model
```markdown
| State | Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0     | Initial state. No device added; user2 has no permissions. |
| 1     | user1 has added one instance of the device; user2 is not invited and has no sharing or control permissions. |
| 2     | Error state. Invalid or undefined operations encountered. |
| 3     | user1 has added one device and attempted to share it with user2; the share operation outcome is unresolved due to conflicting evidence, so user2’s permission status is indeterminate. |
| 4     | user1 has added one device and attempted to share it with user2; user2 manually accepted the share invitation, but actual permission grant is unclear due to the unresolved share operation result. |
```

## Divergent model
| State | Final Semantic Description |
|-------|----------------------------|
| s0    | Initial state: user1 has not added the device; user2 has no permissions or invitations. |
| s1    | user1 has added the device once; user2 has no sharing invitations or permissions. |
| s2    | Error state. |
| s3    | user1 has added the device once and attempted to share with user2; share operation result is undetermined and user2’s permission status is unknown. |
| s4    | user1 added the device once; share attempt result is undetermined; user2 has manually accepted the invitation but permission validity remains uncertain due to unresolved share outcome. |
| s5    | user1 added the device once; sharing outcome remains undetermined; user2 accepted the share and currently controls the device assuming success despite unresolved share status. |
| s6    | user1 added the device once; user2 accepted and controls the device; user1 then unshared the device, revoking user2’s control permissions. |
| s7    | user1 added the device once; after unsharing, user1 reattempted sharing with user2 but share result remains undetermined; user2’s permissions are uncertain following prior acceptance and revocation. |
| s8    | user1 added the device once; user2 accepted the share and controlled the device; subsequently user1 removed the device instance, revoking all user2 permissions and resetting device addition count. |

## Divergent model
* **Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Remote Device Control by user2 Despite Uncertain or Revoked Share Permissions**  
* **Impact:**  
  All reports consistently identify a significant authorization vulnerability in the divergent model where user2 is able to perform remote DeviceControl operations successfully despite the device sharing permission being unresolved (“undetermined” share status), revoked (via UnsharePlug), or ambiguous due to conflicting share operation results. This unauthorized control contradicts the access control rules intended to enforce proper permission grant and revocation, thereby violating the principle of least privilege. The result is an elevated security risk that jeopardizes Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of the device and associated user data. The vulnerability may be exploited by an attacker to manipulate or disrupt device behavior maliciously without legitimate authorization. This fault in permission enforcement reflects CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and highlights weaknesses in share permission validity checks and enforcement logic.

* **Problematic State(s):**  
  * `s4`: user2 performed **remote AcceptDeviceShare** (or DeviceControl in one report), received **success response**, transitioned to **s5** (or remained in s4), enabling device control despite unresolved sharing outcome and permission ambiguity.  
  * `s5`: user2 performed **remote DeviceControl**, received **success response**, remained in **s5**, effectively controlling device with unclear or undetermined sharing permission, violating proper authorization.  
  * `s6`: user1 performed **UnsharePlug** (revoking user2's sharing permission), yet user2 still performed **remote DeviceControl**, received **success response**, showing permission revocation ineffective or not enforced properly.  
  * `s7`: user2 performed **remote AcceptDeviceShare** and/or **DeviceControl** repeatedly, received **success response**, remained in **s7** after sequences of unshare and re-share attempts with undetermined share status, thereby regaining or retaining unauthorized control persistently.

* **Vulnerability 2: Potential Information Leakage via Differential Response Evidence in Share Operations**  
* **Impact:**  
  Multiple reports note evidence of inconsistent, conflicting, or oscillating response indicators (CLS symbols such as CLS_0, CLS_1, CLS_2) accompanying share-related operations (e.g., SharePlug) across divergent states including `s1`→`s3`, `s3` self-loop, `s4`, `s5`, `s6`, and `s7`. These differing symbolic evidences despite similar or identical requests create an opportunity for an attacker (user2) to perform differential inference attacks, revealing internal system states related to share permission success, failure, or conflicts. Such unauthorized inference risks violating confidentiality by leaking sensitive internal state information not otherwise accessible through direct data disclosure. The impact is an enhancement of attack reconnaissance capabilities, allowing attackers to better understand permission states and potentially craft more targeted exploits. However, no direct leakage of other users’ identities or sensitive device attributes beyond control status was observed.

* **Problematic State(s):**  
  * `s1` → `s3`: SharePlug operations produce conflicting CLS_0 vs CLS_1 symbols with differing success/failure response evidences.  
  * `s3` self-loop and onward through `s4`, `s5`, `s6`, `s7`: repeated SharePlug operations manifest conflicting evidence symbols, facilitating differential inference to discern internal permission or share state inconsistencies.

---

**Summary:**  
The divergent model suffers from a critical authorization flaw allowing user2 unauthorized control of a device in states where sharing permission is ambiguous, unresolved, or revoked. Additionally, subtle information leakage is introduced via inconsistent response evidence symbols in share operations, enabling inference of internal system state transitions related to sharing. No vulnerabilities or issues were identified in the base model. Both issues merit corrective action to enforce strict permission validation and to reduce exploitable informational side channels.
