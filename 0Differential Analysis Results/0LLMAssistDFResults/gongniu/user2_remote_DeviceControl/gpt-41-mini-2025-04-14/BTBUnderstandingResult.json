Reason: Majority consensus cannot be reached on the operation result due to conflicting reports: various evidences demonstrate successful HTTP 200 responses with success:true confirming share operation success, while counter-evidences show success:false indicating failure.

Reason: The presence of multiple verbatim indications of failure via success:false responses from POST requests to /mos/share/v1/devices contrasts with the success:true evidences in another entry.
